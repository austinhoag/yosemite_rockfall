I feared that the sheer-fronted Sentinel Rock, which rises to a height of three thousand feet, would be shaken down, and I took shelter back of a big Pine, hoping I might be protected from outbounding boulders, should any come so far... It was a calm moonlight night, and no sound was heard for the first minute or two save a low mumbled underground rumbling and a slight rustling of the agitated trees, as if, in wrestling with the mountains, Nature were holding her breath.  Then, suddenly, out of the strange silence and strange motion there came a tremendous roar.  The Eagle Rock, a short distance up the valley, had given way, and I saw it falling in thousands of the great boulders I had been studying so long, pouring to the valley floor in a free curve luminous from friction, making a terribly sublime and beautiful spectacle - an arc of fire fifteen hundred feet span, as true in form and as steady as a rainbow, in the midst of the stupendous roaring rock-storm.  The sound was inconceivably deep and broad and earnest... The main storm was soon over, and, eager to see the newborn talus, I ran up the valley in the moonlight and climbed it before the huge blocks, after their fiery flight, had come to complete rest.  They were slowly settling into their places, chafing, grating against one another, groaning, and whispering; but no motion was visible except in a stream of small fragments pattering down the face of the cliff at the head of the talus.  A cloud of dust particles, the smallest of the boulders, floated out across the whole breadth of the valley and formed a ceiling that lasted until after sunrise; and the air was loaded with the odor of crush Douglas Spruces, from a grove that had been mowed down and mashed like weeds."""

Mr. Snow, on hearing the terrible rumbling noise preceding the shake, rushed out of his house somewhat alarmed.  The night was very light and he being in plain view of the Nevada Falls, distinctly saw that water ceased to flow over the falls for at least half a minute.  A large mass of rocks, which would weigh thousands of tons fell from the west side of the 'Cap of Liberty' about a thousand feet above its base.  When this great mass of rocks struck the earth Mr. Snow says he was instantaneously thrown prostrate to the ground.  The house, which stands on the solid bed rock which has an incline of about twenty degrees to the eastward towards the Cap of Liberty and Nevada Falls, has moved two inches to the east.  An addition to the house, which was built last Fall, was so badly wrecked and shattered as to have to be taken down and rebuilt.  The earth around Snow's place is still completely covered with dust from the pulverized rocks.  I think that the prostration of Mr. Snow, and perhaps the moving of the main house and the wrenching apart of the timbers of the addition, was probably more the result of the concussion of the atmosphere when the rocks fell than the effects of the shake.""

The surveying party were in the vicinity at the time and hearing the crash, Jarvis Streeter Jr. and Wade Suff went to see the cause and found Allen still alive.  He had been struck by a boulder as he was walking along, and fatally injured and, lived but a short time after he was found.  He was cared for as well as circumstances would admit of, and was buried in the Big Meadows on the Coulterville road below the Valley.""     (2) From the Mariposa Gazette (3 April 1886, p. 3, col. 4):  ""It was a sad day for poor Jack Allen when he fell victim to one of the remarkable freaks of nature, in the shape of a cave[-in] or a slide from a high and almost perpendicular mountain, which overhangs the trail leading up the Merced river, about three miles below the romantic spot known as the Cascade Falls.  It is a lonely, uninhabited section of the river for miles either way from where the accident occurred, and the travel along the trail would scarcely average one person a day the whole year round.  In the course of time, there has evidently been some very heavy land slides at this and other points along the river, where the high pre[c]ipitate mountains forms a deep canyon through which the beautiful Merced river passes after leaving the Great Valley, a short distance above.  It was on the 21st day of last month (March 1886), when poor Jack was plodding his way along this lonely trail leading to the Yosemite Valley, with a view, no doubt, to seeking employment during the business season.  As he was passing underneath the terrible avalanche, he must have heard the noise and turned around to look back, bringing his right side toward the mountain, as the rock struck him.  When examined, four ribs on the right side were broken, his right ankle was badly broken, and leg immediately below the knee crushed and right arm broken.  He had evidently been hurt about an hour, when the two boys, Streeter and Duff, of the surveying party, found him, which was about noon.  He was alive and could talk a little.  Had it not been for the road Surveyors, Gould & Co. who were encamped at the Cascade Falls, the accident would, no doubt, have been unknown for some days afterwards.  They had broken up camp that morning; Gould and two of his men had gone off on the mountain toward the Big Meadow to hunt a section corner.  Streeter and Duff were to go ahead down the river to Whorton's, below, to see about some animals, leaving Frank Latchaw with the pack animals to bring up the rear.  The surveying party had about completed the survey of road and were preparing to start for home.  When Streeter and Duff came upon the slide from the mountain they found the trail embedded to such an extent that it was impassible for an animal, and were about starting back to inform Latchaw who was in charge of the pack train when they discovered a bundle or sack filled with something that had the appearance of clothes, belonging to some late traveler.  The thought that some one might have been passing and caught in the mighty dead-fall, occurred to them when they commenced to allo; and repeated some several times, when their first presentiments were realized, by a faint response coming from among the rocks and debris some 15 or 20 yards below where the trail passed.  They soon found the unfortunate man lying prostrate upon the rocks and put him in as comfortable position as they possibly could.  After a short consultation with the wounded man it was decided to go back as quick as possible for other help.  Allen had told the boys he could not live long, so away they went as speedily as possible to inform the other members of the surveying party of the accident.  Latchaw, with his train, was intercepted and turned back as it was impracticable to get down the river owing to the condition of the trail caused by the slide.  They then went on to the mountain in search of Gould and the two assistants, Coop and Gallison, who were with him, and as soon as found, they all hastened to the spot where Allen was last seen alive.  Nearly five hours had elapsed since he was found by Duff and Streeter, before this party returned.  Allen had, in his last agonies, struggled and got himself in an upright sitting position, in which he had died.  How long he had been dead was hard to tell, it was a pity to have left him alone after being found, although no more relief could be given than was done by the boys before they left him at noon.  The next thing to be done was to convey the body to some place for burial and the nearest respectable point was the Big Meadow, about six miles away.  To accomplish this, two and a half miles of trail was to be gone over before reaching the Coulterville wagon road, and from thence up a steep mountain some two miles long; from thence to the spot of interment.    This was no small task; a litter had to be cons[t]ructed out of the bushes and poles, trail being quite narrow, it fell upon two men at a time to carry the dead man until the wagon road was reached.  The next morning Surveyor Gould transformed himself into an undertaker and made a rude coffin, while others dug the grave, by the side of unfortunate John Johnson, who, a short time since was found dead on the Oak Flat Road, though to have perished from cold and exhaustion.  Thus concludes a chapter of the last days of poor John Henry Allen, who met with death under such peculiar circumstances.  He was a native of Nova Scotia, aged 57 or 58 years, and was a pioneer of this county."""

Many of the trees were broken and covered by the falling rock and the rest of them were uprooted or had the tops whipped off by the vacuum created by the falling rock.  This vacuum caused an inrush of air which was strong enough to knock down 500 feet of the high tension electric line, carrying 11,000 volts, breaking and uprooting several of the poles.  The number of trees destroyed cannot by ascertained as hundreds of them are under the rock.  It is estimated that between five hundred and six hundred trees were destroyed.  It took one truck, two span of horses, and five men, five and one-half days to clear the road.  Two hundred pounds of TNT, and three hundred pounds of picric acid were also used in doing this work.""

Over a part of the area covered by the slide all plant life was either swept away or buried under rock.  Over another section, where the slide was not as severe, some trees and shrubs, although badly injured, survived….  The central part of the talus did not receive as heavy a fall of rock as the eastern section, and in certain high or protected lines the original vegetation is still standing. In this section there is no doubt that the Yellow Pine was the predominating tree with only a few Golden Cup Oaks to be found in scattered places.  There were also, however, a fairly large number of Douglas Firs and maples...  Many trees even in this section that were twenty-four inches or even more in diameter were snapped off like toothpicks.  Many of the logs still remain on the surface, and they too indicated that this was predominantly a Yellow Pine forest. …"""

So thick, indeed, was this cloud that it blotted out the sun in the general area of the slide and made it impossible to determine for the time just what had happened.  Only as this cloud moved up the valley, rising almost to the top of the walls, was the magnitude of the slide revealed.  Dust was deposited in the upper valley.  High on the south wall of the valley, within a hundred or so feet of the top and across the ravine of Sentinel Fall from Sentinel Rock, a huge section of the shoulder of a cliff had broken off leaving a scar of perhaps several acres of loose and weathered rock.  The tremendous concussion caused by this slide started a second slide from the west shoulder of Sentinel Rock itself about 1,000 feet from the top...  It is difficult to determine just what started these rock slides.  It is worth noting, however, that at the time of the slides the sun had just crept around to a position which allowed it to shine on these cliffs for the first time that day.  It is possible that this warmed the area sufficiently to melt any ice which might have been holding loose rock in place.  Or movement might have been started by expansion of the loose rock mass, warmed by the sun.  Whatever the cause, according to old residents, this is undoubtedly the largest and most spectacular rock slide which has occurred in Yosemite Valley during about the last twenty-five years.  So spectacular was this phenomena that a considerable crowd of people immediately assembled in the general region within minutes after it was first seen and heard- people who were accustomed to numerous rock slides during any year.""     (2)  From Ghiglieri and Farabee, Jr. (2007):  ""In mere seconds at about 2 p.m. on October 23, 1949, one humongous rock slab fell from the west shoulder of Sentinel Rock.  Its impact sent up a thick mushroom cloud of dust that reduced visibility to literally a few feet in the eastern end of the Valley.  Half Dome vanished from view.  Cars in motion abruptly slowed to a snail's pace.  Drivers poked their heads out side windows and blinked away dust-stained tears while gasping for breath through handkerchiefs.

This later slide descended to within a few hundred yards of the parking area at the valley terminus of the Four Mile Trail to Glacier Point.  About 600 feet of the lower end of this trail was wiped out, as it was covered to a depth of from two to six feet of loose rock debris.  Mature trees were splintered or sheared off while still others stood stark beneath the cliff shorn of all their branches.  Those trees and shrubs which were otherwise unaffected were heavily covered with a thick coating of rock dust, which would rise in a miniature cloud when the plant was shaken.  Dust lay an eighth of an inch thick over the rocks and ground for a quarter of a mile.... Miss Lois Nordlinger has given a vivid eyewitness account.  She and Betty Barnard were on horseback in the immediate region at the time of the slides.  ""We looked up just as the first rocks were breaking loose from the top of Sentinel Rock.  We didn't think too much about it at first, believing it to be just another small slide.  We kept watching as we rode along.  Suddenly the slide gained momentum and larger boulders were swept down. We stared, hypnotized, our horses tense and trembling.  We could see great boulders shearing the branches from trees along the cliff wall; the noise increased, the low rumble was terrifying.  Suddenly the foremost part of the slide hit bottom and dense clouds of dust and debris arose.  It seemed as if a huge tidal wave were advancing toward us.  Within seconds we were completely enveloped, unable to see the trees next to us and obscured from each other.  The dust became fiery red, filled with flying sparks caused by intense friction.  There and then we decided we'd better get out of here before we were goners.  Simultaneously, we wheeled our horses and raced back to the 'Old Village', the billowing dust in hot pursuit."" ... Although the major rock slides occurred on 23 October 1949, numerous slides of considerable proportions continued over a period of several weeks.

Their ride went to hell three miles up from Happy Isles, just below Clark Point.  It was just after noon when, from a few hundred feet above them and sounding like a loud cannon booming, tons of granite exfoliated from a cliff.  The disintegrating slab accelerated, breaking into ever-smaller chunks as it ricocheted down slope.  The big pieces sheared off small oak trees as they cascaded.  Ewing, leading the mules, quickly dismounted and tried to flatten himself against a rock face... Meanwhile Scarborough was positioned as sweep on the trail, ten feet behind the last mule.  With a bit less advance warning than Herb Ewing got, he entered the path of the rock slide precisely at the wrong instant.  The avalanche knocked him and his doomed horse off the switchback and down the brush-choked slope nearly 100 feet.

Rackusin) had been swimming at Hidden Falls along Tenaya Creek upstream of Mirror Lake on the afternoon of 28 June 28 1977.  When the weather turned threatening the two decided to leave by hiking down a faint ""social"" trail adjacent to the creek.  Upstream an afternoon thunderstorm delivered substantial precipitation to the Tenaya Creek watershed, most intensely on nearby Half Dome.  Marble-sized hail twice forced the Rackusins to seek shelter under an overhanging cliff.  Within view of the Rackusins and also hiding under a ledge, visitor David Mahvi heard a ""rumbling"" and ""whooshing"" from up-canyon.  Peering upstream he saw a ""large amount of mud and debris coming down the canyon towards him"".  He yelled to the Rackusins, ""Watch out!"", then climbed higher for safety.  When Mahvi looked back over his shoulder, he saw Bryna Rackusin already caught standing in the flood.  The muddy flow quickly knocked her off her feet and started to carry her downstream.  Almost immediately, however, her foot became wedged between a boulder and a log.  Jeffrey Rackusin waded in to assist his wife.  Three other visitors - Robert Rogers, Bob Dubuison, and Clark Hine - appeared and began to aid the Rackusins, both of whom were now engulfed by the rising flood.  The three men joined Jeffrey in attempting to extricate Byrna, but after twenty minutes of effort she remained pinned.  At that point a second, higher flood wave came ""gushing down Tenaya Creek from above"".  It knocked Bryna loose and swept her away, and also carried off Jeffrey Rackusin and Bob Dubuison.  Dubuison managed to make his way to shore, but both Rackusins were swept downstream where they drowned.    (2)  On 14 July 1977, Ranger Don Coehlo interviewed Interpretive Ranger David Balogh, who observed the storm event from Glacier Point:  ""Ranger Balogh related that at approximately 1500 hours he observed an extremely large thunder storm building up over the Merced River drainage with an extremely large amount of precipitation falling beneath it...  The storm moved fairly rapidly towards Tenaya Canyon; he stated that Clouds Rest literally disappeared in the cloud.  The storm moved over Half Dome but the dome did not disappear.  Balogh states he observed sheets of water coming off of Half Dome...as if someone had turned a shower nozzle on from above... He observed very large amounts of water running down [Clouds Rest] into Tenaya Canyon... [Balogh] states that he has worked in Yosemite for five summers and has never seen anything like this storm... storms of such intensity are quite rare in the Sierra.""    (3)  In an National Park Service incident report dated 28 June 1977, Ranger Don Coelho states the following:  ""[Myself] and Ranger Calkings walked up the watercourse [after the flow had diminished] and observed the following:  much loose gravel and rock in a very unstable condition.  Unstable conditions suggests recent movement to their existing locations.  The rocks varied from small gravel to grapefruit size.  The bark stripped off all live trees and shrubs bordering the watercourse from top to bottom.  The growth looks as if it had been sandblasted, suggesting movement of water with much rapidity and force... Residue shows the slide consisted of water, sand, small rock and gravel and much mulch and leafy type material... Watercourse appears to be an old course, but by looking at the vegetation along its borders it appears to have been widened by approximately ten feet on both sides. ... The spot where the witnesses state the victims had been standing... shows a new vertical cut of six and one half feet deep by sixteen yards wide down through the soil.  Creek edge shows a four foot diameter Douglas Fir completely uprooted, lying on its side.... The water came down a large rock gully named ""Northeast Gully"", below Ahwiyah Point.""     (4)  Balogh (1978) described the thunderstorm and associated flood:  ""From Glacier Point the bottom of the cloud seems to erupt, and the whole Merced River drainage above Nevada Falls disappears, enveloped by a gray curtain...Slowly, almost imperceptibly the cloud moves northward towards Clouds Rest, the divide between the Merced River drainage and the narrow glacial canyon of Tenaya Creek.  Rain falls on Half Dome, Clouds Rest completely disappears, not in the cloud, but in the rain.  So much water falls on Half Dome that water begins to streak down its massive flanks... Thousands of gallons of white water in hundreds of channels flow down to Yosemite Valley.  All of Tenaya Canyon disappears from view... 4:00 p.m. The cloudburst moves from Clouds Rest toward Mt. Hoffmann.  When Clouds Rest becomes visible the enormity of the storm becomes apparent.  In every possible path on the huge mass of granite, water, not in rivulets, but in torrents descends towards Tenaya Creek... Clouds Rest is white on top from snow and below the 8,000 [foot] level from water, sliding, free-falling, pushing, lubricating, washing, turning soil to mud; moving more earth in five minutes than a hydraulic gold mine in a day... Hikers on the Tenaya Trail switchbacks ran for cover.  Most said that they could not see the storm until it was upon them.  Many escaped with only a few bruises.  Two did not.  Mudslides and the flash flood took two lives shortly after 4:00 p.m. above Mirror Lake.  Tenaya Creek roared into Mirror Lake like a runaway express train.  Almost all of the sand bar marking the most recent filling of the lake disappeared within ten minutes.  But the presence of the lake saved further damage and possible loss of life downstream, for the energy of the running water was dissipated by the lake."""

The 300-foot fallen slab had been attached to the wall only by a ""hinge"" of granite along the left edge.

Then as the mass shifted, pressure on the most narrow and fractured part at the top produced a ragged horizontal break and the slab came crashing down.  For about thirty seconds, rock hurtled down over a half mile of talus.  Breaking up as it came, the slab dropped fragments ranging in size from dust to 125 tons on to the talus slope below.

He was in the second vehicle, and stopped for about fifteen minutes at a friend's house located that the former Cascades housing area just upstream of the Cookie Cliff area.  When he left the house at about 22:30 he quickly encountered a large tree and boulder across the road.  He returned to his friends house at Cascades to alert Park Dispatch that a front-end loader would be needed to remove the tree and boulder.  Ewert decided to return to the slide area to look around while he waited for the front-end loader.  With a flashlight, he began walking down the road and quickly realized that the slide was far larger than he originally thought, with many house-sized boulders where the road used to be. Ewert immediately thought of his companion, who had driven through this area about 15 minutes prior, and began searching for her vehicle in the debris.   As he worked his way across the slide, he lost track of the road due to the accumulation of debris.  He could hear small boulders still falling above, and noted a creek flowing through the debris that he hadn't noticed before [this was effluent from the broken sewer line].  He did not find evidence of a vehicle [she had passed through just before the slide occurred].  He could, however, see headlights through the mist up above him, so climbed back up to the road.  There he encountered a park visitor, clearly upset by the situation, who demanded to know when the road would be reopened.

Beneath this overhang some slabs of rock had partly separated from the rock face as shown by recent minor movements.  Other slabs may have been previously separated as evidenced by caliche deposits, water staining and small diameter tree roots (5 cm) visible between slabs.  The slabs beneath the overhang were delicately interlocked and some appeared not to be connected to the steeply inclined rock face beneath.  On 6 March, a 3 to 5 m-long, fine fresh crack was detected about 20 m upslope of the overhang.  This crack, with about 0.5 cm of extensional opening roughly paralleled a deep, weathered joint but did not connect to any other cracks near the overhang. The 0.5-1.0 m wide weathered joint was filled with gruss and pine needles from a nearby pine tree growing in the joint.""     (3) From Wieczorek et al.

This talus is also underneath another intermittent creek which can carry notable flows off the open, slickrock cliffs above and a great deal of ice in the winter.

The most recent block did not fall very far, hitting a bench which changed its direction to the center of the talus and breaking it up.

Much smaller rock falls from Middle Brother had begun on March 8, and by about 2:20 p.m. on 10 March, because of an increasing number of rock falls and audible rock popping noises from the face of Middle Brother, Northside Drive, the main exit road from the valley, had been closed and the portion of Leidig Meadow below Middle Brother had been cordoned off.  On the afternoon of 10 March, Jim Snyder observed the rock fall initiate as an intact planar slab of rock that separated from the cliff face.  As the slab fell it appeared to shorten in a folding-like manner similar to the steps of an escalator.  The slab disaggregated into a rock avalanche upon hitting and sliding along a prominent ledge before falling onto the talus cone below.  Another large rock fall from the face of Middle Brother occurred later that day at 5:10 p.m.  The volume of these rock falls totaled an estimated 600,000 cubic meters of material weighing about 1.3 million metric tons.  Dozens of smaller rock falls continued during the next several days ...  During and preceding March 8-10, the weather was dry without extreme temperature variations that might be associated with freeze-thaw or snowmelt cycles.  Likewise  no earthquakes occurred during this period that could account for this sudden onset of rock falls.  During the following two weeks a high number of small rock falls occurred, some of which could be attributed to storms and the abundant loose rock on the ledge beneath the face of Middle Brother.  In April after these storms, the rock fall activity noticeably diminished, but remained at a relatively constant rate.  By June the rock fall frequency had dropped even more and Northside Drive was reopened for the first time in early July.  A brief flareup of rock fall activity in early August again required the closing of Northside Drive, but rock fall activity quickly diminished and the road was reopened."""

Far above us, from the very top of the point, some refrigerator sized rocks fell silently through the slanting morning sunlight.  My friend saw them first.  He was leading and called down to us to ""watch out!"".  Well, you know the route, no place to hide, besides they were falling far off to the side, so I watched as they fell.  They seemed to fall rather strangely slowly, turning over in the air, still no sound.  Then they struck the top of the slanting apron and immediately exploded, sending fragments in a 180 degree arc.  The shrapnel seemed to suddenly accelerate to phenomenal speeds.  Even though the contact point was hundreds of yards sideways and above us, I barely had time to throw my back flat against the rock before a piece of stone the size of a garbage can lid skimmed about six inches over me.  It was like a scene straight out of 'Star Wars' as the piece skimmed like a fighter jet down the rest of the apron, maintaining its improbably close proximity to the rock face until it hit the bottom with a crash."""

It is fairly new, however, showing up in July 1996, photographs from the talus cone of the Happy Isles rock slide.  No lichen or moss or marks of drainage have formed on the fallen blocks, nor has any vegetation grown up among them.  The broken trees have still enough freshness about them to conclude the slide occurred late winter or early spring, 1996.  It occurred at a time when few people were on the Mirror Lake loop, probably during a storm, for the thunder from this rock fall would certainly otherwise have been reported.  Like the Happy Isles rock slide, this one consisted of a long arched slab on a face of more massive granite which had been subject to periodic peeling for long enough that the talus cone below reached out underneath the trail to Tenaya Creek itself.  The failed slab was, to judge from weathering lines along the edges, about 500 ft. long and 200 ft. high.  Its thickness was probably 10 to 20 feet.  Though composed of Half Dome Granodiorite, the rock at the source area was both massive and more finely jointed than surrounding rock.  At the top of the source area, trees and other vegetation had sent roots well down behind and into the failed slab.  There is a strata of more finely jointed rock running east to west through the cliff approximately a third of the way down from the top of the source area.  This weakness, with the penetration by roots, may have contributed to the eventual failure.  The source area lies between 5,360 and 5,560 feet elevation, some 600-700 feet west of the creek running down from Basket Dome.  A clear bench above the source area has a thick woods of canyon live oak with scattered pines.  When it fell, the slab probably broke up immediately, as thin as it was, but it dropped, slid, and dropped further before reaching the talus.  Its velocity carried blocks about 600 feet down the talus slope into the woods just above the trail.  The woods there of oak, fir, cedar, and pine were simply obliterated.  The foot of the talus from this fall is a kind of topographic step formed of jumbled blocks each of 10-15 feet diameter.

(2012b)","(1) From Snyder (1996) and Wieczorek et al. (2000):  At 17:52 PST on 10 July 1996 two rock falls only seconds apart occurred near Happy Isles in the Yosemite Valley (blocks A and B) without any apparent triggering event.  From a developing arch-like cliff between Washburn and Glacier Point several hundred meters above the Tioga glacial trim line, the rock masses started sliding along a steeply inclined plane.  Traveling down this plane their horizontal velocity was sufficient to launch the falling masses, which cleared the base of the cliff and hit the talus 500 m below.  The first mass (block A) was estimated to be 15%-20% the size of the second (block B); together the two masses amounted to a volume of between 23 and 38 thousand  cubic meters.  The two rock falls hit the talus slope 13.6 seconds apart; their separate impacts were recorded by seismographic stations in western Nevada and central California.  The impacts of these large, still largely intact rock masses (blocks A and B) onto the talus slope generated an air blast that traveled well beyond the limit of fresh rock on the talus slope and knocked down or snapped 1000 trees that damaged the Happy Isles Nature Center, destroyed a snack bar, killed one person, and seriously injured several other people in the vicinity of Happy Isles.  Shortly following the air blast, a rapidly moving cloud including coarse sand and finer particles was generated from the impact that enveloped the area of the Nature Center and Happy Isles in a thick cloud of dust that for several minutes blocked out the early evening sunlight.  Later that evening and early the next morning two additional large pieces of rock from the southern section of the cliff broke loose and followed an alternate path down a chute that added to the upper southern part of the talus.  Bouncing and breaking up along this path, these masses did not reach the talus as large intact pieces and there was no large air blast as with the two earlier rock falls.  Smaller pieces of the arch fell later that evening (block C) and early the next morning (block D).  These blocks from the southern, thinner end of the arch took a different path than blocks A and B that had fallen earlier.  Instead of sliding on the ramp and then free falling, blocks C and D disaggregated as they followed a chute to the southeast that funneled onto the apex of the previous talus cone.  Smaller pieces of the arch continued to collapse, slide, and fall during the following days and weeks, continuing until at least early August.     (2) From Mark Grossi in The Fresno Bee (3 November 1999):  The concussion knocked down huge trees, which crushed and killed Emiliano Morales, 20, of Montebello, who was standing near an ice cream stand.  Fourteen other people were injured: one woman was left paralyzed.     (3)  According to Dick Ewert (oral commun., March 2012):  At the time of the rock fall Ranger Dick Ewert was at his residence at Glacier Point when he felt a slight shaking.  Immediately thereafter he heard a roaring sound that he described as a squadron of jet fighters flying low overhead.  He was unaware of the source of the noise and shaking until about twenty minutes later, when he realized the view of Half Dome from Glacier Point was obscured by dust.     (4)  Watts et al. (2007) and Watters et al. (2007) hypothesized that the 1996 Happy Isles rock fall was triggered by leachate discharged from a leachfield located upslope of the rock-fall source area; this hypothesis was evaluated by Stock et al. (2012) and shown to be highly unlikely based on the frequency of rock falls from Glacier Point and the vastly larger quantities of water produced by local snowmelt."

Search and rescue crews, complete with a canine unit and helicopters, searched the area this afternoon for hikers who may have been caught in the rock fall.  No fatalities have been reported, and no one has been called in missing.  The rock fall has caused the National Park Service to close the 3.7-mile trail to the top of Yosemite Falls for a short time after the fall, but the trail is now open again.

Park ranger Susan Gonshor said the slide was 'quite small' by Sierra rockfall standards.  It occurred at about 9:45 a.m., sending a cascade of rocks and trees onto the trail about 1,000 feet up from the Yosemite Valley floot.  The incident apparently caused no casualties, Gonshor said.  'We will be searching the slide with a dog team and trail crews once the stability of the area has been assured,' said Gonshor.  'There is still some loose material between the release point and the trail.  So far, we have no reports of injuries or missing hikers.'  Gonshor said the trail will remain closed for at least a day.  'The crews have to clean the debris off, but they should be able to do it by hand,' she said.  'Most of the rocks weren't any bigger than three feet across, and the trees were only about six or eight inches in diameter.'

At least two other rock slides have occurred in recent years in this vicinity (IDs 1987041201, 1990042301).  The newest slide came from a shelf perhaps 300 feet above the trail, where part of a thick slab had sat on a steeply inclined plane.  Breakage at the east end of the slab had apparently been accelerated by intrusion of tree roots, but the majority of the thick, clean break at the source area showed no roots.  The block that fell was approximately 150 feet long, 25 feet high, and 30 feet thick.  The block sat on a bedrock plane inclined at about 40 degrees.  The block fell at 16:00 on 17 November 1996, making enough noise to be heard and reported by employees and visitors in Yosemite Valley.  The block fell a short distance, slid down a broad inclined plane, then fell again, breaking up as it went down to leave a clutter of large blocks on the slope and trail, reaching the edge of Mirror Lake.  As the block fell, it broke off a couple smaller slabs.  One was 3 ft. thick, 10 ft. wide, and about 25 ft. long, part of a climbing route just above the top of the talus.  This slab, broken by impact, simply slid intact the few feet to the top of the talus.  On 17 November 1996, a total of 3.7 inches [9.4 cm] of rain fell in Yosemite Valley followed by 2.6 inches [6.6 cm] the following day, the first of a series of fairly heavy storms which built up the snowpack and began the process of soil saturation preceding the 1 January 1997 flood."""

While this flow occurred during the flood storm, the flow was anticipated by the unusual rock fall of 10-11 July 1996.  That rock fall left new elements on the topography.  Where the largest blocks hit, disintegrating on impact, they left high mounds of loose, unconsolidated material.  When saturated and mixed with rapidly flowing water, parts of the mounds gave way, flowing out toward the fen, burying about two acres and much of the vegetation knocked down by the July rock fall up to ten feet deep.  The small Happy Isles power house was buried three to four feet deep in 6 inches - rock and sand.  The upper springhouse from 1912 was overtopped and buried, as were some remaining sections of the old trail with its walls and culverts in that area.  The topography was altered yet again, as the sharp toe of earlier slides and debris flows creating a six to ten-foot elevation drop in the fen was smoothed, given a gentle, even gradient by the new flow of material from the rock fall.   Traditional channels for water were changed, as were underground springs.  In the debris flow were many springs, whose the water had a strong smell, a little like sewage, with a brown color and rapidly growing fungus.  This must have been from the vegetation ground up by the slide, leaching out and rotting.  The burial of more vegetation by the flow may have increased this process, for there was more water and much more discoloration in February than during the months following the rock fall last July.  By the end of March the water was beginning to clear. … There are still shoals of gravel here.  Sand was carried all the way down to the boardwalk where it is several inches deep behind that structure.  But this point, 675 feet, is sort of the end of the continuous spreading flow.  Farther down, material was carried by water along an existing channel.  There is about ten feet of relief in front of the old debris flow lobe at the edge of the spring boxes and the edge of the trail as measured in areas kept free of debris flows by trees fallen during the airblast.  The debris flow is about 200 feet across at its widest point, but there is great variation in width because of the damming and redirecting of material by airblasted trees."""

Six to eight feet thick, saturated, iron-rich soils slumped along decomposed bedrock forming a slip joint along which water flowed.  This was not the first movement in this particular slump.  I recall some trees down from minor slumping at this point in the in the storms of March, 1986.  The present slump opened up in its most recent form about spring, 1995, after which the rock wall was begun in it to shore up remaining material.  During the flood, more saturated soils collapsed from the headwall of the slump to flow over the new wall and across the road. Drainage from the slump gullied the downhill side of the road and deeply gullied a part of the old Wawona Road below.  There is a long history of problems with the Wawona Road in this stretch.  Problems began as the road was being built. Problems at Grouse Creek began during construction in 1932 with slides coming out of new road cuts in the wet spring months.  Heavy storms in April 1935, caused more slumping in roadcuts along the road.  Slumping at Grouse Creek was continual during March and April 1936, when 17 men were kept working removing material and shoring up the cut banks.  A rock wall was built at this slump, using rock pulled down from retaining walls on the Old Wawona Road.  The wall is partly overgrown now but stabilized this slump at the time.  In the flood of 1937 Grouse Creek took out the entire road, leaving a 20-foot-deep channel through the relatively new fills.  The road crossing of Grouse Creek was washed out again in the 1955 flood, leaving a crater 40 feet across and 20 feet deep."""

Impact marks on older rocks well up the bank show large rocks moving at fast speeds.  Rocks in the streambed were hit, scraped, gouged, shorn of older patinas and rough edges.  There was a little channel cutting just below the falls, but the cutting there was controlled in part by two large rocks at the head of the channel's first turn.  The real cutting started just below this first turn with the two large blocks forming a gully head.  Banks had collapsed in this area before. At this first turn this time the creek picked up additional loads, probably more suddenly than gradually.  This material in turn helped cut into the steepest banks to bring more material into the stream.  The greatest deposition occurred at the mouth of the gorge where the water was suddenly not confined. New material dumped there amounted to about 2,100 cubic yards.  There was probably a time sequence in the way this happened.  The historic channel was quite shallow at the top of the alluvial fan, the creek barely making the sharp turn at the gorge mouth.  But a lot of water moved down the straighter 1983-1986 channel too.  There was not as much material this time as in 1983, and the material contained more fines.  In 1983 there were large boulders up to five feet in diameter on the trail across this new branch and deep (three feet or more) accumulations of 18-inch-cobbles and fines.  There was some material on the trail from 1997 but the trail remained mostly visible, while the west end of it suffered a small washout rather than burial by new material.  It appears that Sentinel Creek first jumped the low barrier from 1986 to go down the straight channel.  It was carrying much water from the storms but less load.  It probably began depositing at the mouth of the gorge early, but the presence of large rocks and gradation of the deposition pile in a talus-like fashion from larger to smaller rocks seems to indicate a more sudden event.  Channel wall collapse greatly increased the load and volume of the creek with quick deposition at the gorge mouth.  Even with that deposition, the creek overtopped the pile for a time and carried fines down the straighter channel toward the road.  But deposition also forced the creek to turn east, where it rejected its historic channel and braided its way to the road beyond the historic and the 1983 channel.  Much of the volume ran under the original road crossing anyway.  In this stretch of new channel  cutting and braiding down the fan, the creek picked up and moved more material from new sources, carrying it a little ways down the new channels until gradient and obstacles forced deposition, leaving fines to be carried to road and river.  The quick deposition of large material at the mouth of the gorge of Sentinel Creek was the main reason there was less road impact in 1997 than there was from earlier storms.  In 1997 the material came from the bank sides along the approximately 1,000 foot long gorge.  In earlier events material had come from much higher elevations, in turn loosening material in the bank walls of the gorge.  Much of that 'new' 1983 material continues in evidence in the fresh white rock of the straight channel between the gorge mouth and the bridle path."""

Part of Staircase had flowed black with mud during the day.  It brought new alluvium to the small fan at the cliff base and washed material around some of the cabins and out into Camp Curry. The material-laden fall may have been precursor, even initiator, of the small rock slide later in the evening.  One rock about six inches diameter hit the roof of Camp Curry cabin 72B, and the occupants of cabins 72 and 73 were evacuated in case there were any more to come.  The rock on the roof was a fragment cracked off and sent flying in the collision of a couple of blocks farther up the hill from the cabins.  There is a relatively small talus slope below Staircase Fall.  The new rock stands out, as do the trees it hit and scraped.  The new rocks were on the west side of the creek and scattered over about a hundred feet behind a large block marking the fall line to the rear of cabins 72 and 73. The new rocks were roughly 4 x 3 x 3 feet and 3 x 1.5 x 1.5 feet.  There were also four 1.5 feet square blocks and a 30 inch square block.  [Note:  concessionaire security staff member Dave Marino witnessed one of these smaller blocks strike a tree and land on the snow-covered ground.  He clearly heard a hissing sound as the rock melted into the snow, producing steam.  This indicates that the rock was extremely hot, presumably due to frictional heating associated with impacts/fragmentation along the fall path].  We could see a fresh small scar at about 4,800 ft., just right of the fall in a cliff face which receives a lot of water and forms ice.  The rocks bounced and slid down the face to hit the talus slope, from which they bounded down, leaving impact depression, scars and broken trees.  The source of the rock appears to have been a pocket of less massive, more fractured and weathered rock from which this has not been the first failure.  While there had been ice associated with this location, it was obviously the heavier flood-producing rains that generated this particular rock fall.""

He said there were a number of large boulders (he thought might be a little over 10 feet in diameter) cascading down the cliff in the traditional fall line or drainage to the top of the talus slope.  He could not tell if they hit the projecting buttress above the top of the talus cone first, but thought they bounded around it.  The largest rock hit the talus slope, well out from the cliff face, and hit it hard enough that it sent other large rocks from the talus slope flying into the air. … The rock slide sounded small enough that locating a source might be difficult, especially if it came from the south side of the older source.  It does not sound like there was enough impact to the projecting buttress to enlarge the crack through it generated by the 1996 rock fall, but it may still be worth checking.  Without a previous measurement, it would probably be impossible to tell of any change.  Jack was very clear about the initial sound, which was a snap or pop rather than the sound of impact.

No previous historic rock falls have been recorded from this source area.  The source area is slightly above the glacial trim line of Matthes (1930) for the Tioga glaciation and these rocks have been exposed to weathering for more than the last 1 million years.  The arch-like rock mass involved in this rock-fall event was composed of granodioritic and tonalitic rocks from a unit included in the Sentinel Granodiorite by Calkins (in Matthes, 1930) [later mapped as the granodiorite of Glacier Point by D.L. Peck (2002)]...  The first rock fall in a sequence from the location above Curry Village occurred on 16 November 1998 and had a volume of about 736 yards3 [563 m3] (1738 tons).  The block(s) fell 100-150 feet down the  steep (75°) cliff face to ledge, breaking up against the cliff.  From there the rock fell another 950 feet, breaking up more before hitting the top of the talus.  The size and velocity of the rocks were sufficient to knock over and clear many large trees from the upper part of the talus.  The rocks continued to bounce, roll, and slide down the talus, their paths determined in part by the distribution of larger boulders from prehistoric rock falls and large trees which either stopped or directed their paths.  The rocks that travelled farthest, about 1,600 feet from the top of the talus, took a northeasterly direction.  Large rocks reached within about 75 feet of the closest tent cabin (Tent 29), highest on the talus.  Smaller, mostly fist-sized pieces of fresh rock were found considerably beyond the limit of the larger rock blocks.  The paths of the larger rock blocks could be traced through the forest by noting the trail of crushed vegetation, shattered boulders, and impact craters, whereas the smaller pieces were presumably airborne projectiles from points of impact along the cliff and high on the talus.  Although large dust clouds were generated, no airblasts were observed from any of these rock falls, presumably because the rock blocks broke into moderate-sized pieces in impacts along the cliff by the time they reached the talus.... A trigger for the 16 November 1998 rock fall cannot be precisely determined.  Minimum daily temperatures fell below freezing for 11 of 12 days prior to failure.  During that same period 2.14 inches [5.4 cm] of rain fell with 0.40 inches  [1 cm] in the 24-hour period preceding the rock fall.  With the freezing temperatures and the availability of water, there is a strong possibility that the expansion of water in the joints during freezing and of the buildup of pore water pressures during thawing of the ice, weakened the rock mass and triggered the rock fall.... Another rock fall was heard in the same vicinity behind Curry Village at 10:50.  An additional four or five smaller rock falls occurred later that night.""    (2) Guzzetti et al. (2003) mapped and modeled the runout extent and trajectories of this rock fall using the STONE rock-fall simulation model.     (3)  Matasci et al.

(4)  Watts et al. (2007) and Watters et al. (2007) hypothesized that the 1998-1999 Curry Village rock falls were triggered by an overflowing water tank located upslope of the Glacier Point parking lot; this hypothesis was evaluated by Stock et al.

Twenty-two hikers were trapped above the slide.  They were moved to a landing zone above Yosemite Falls and evacuated by two helicopters.  The trail will remain closed indefinitely while it is further assessed.""     (2) According to Jim Snyder (written commun. 29 April 1999):  ""This rock fall was coincident with the 1980 rock fall along the Yosemite Falls Trail ID 1980111601.  At about 1 p.m. 21 April 1999, a rock fall occurred in the upper Yosemite Falls gully.  …The rock slide was evaluated that afternoon by Dan Horner, Jose Lopez, and Jim Snyder by helicopter, but there was too much wind for a very good look.  A more thorough evaluation of the source area by air and from the ground was conducted by Mark Fincher, Tim Ludington, and Jim Snyder on 26 April, after giving the slide a few days to settle.  Evaluation of the rock slide led to the following conclusions:       1.  This small rock fall was part of a continuing rock fall as the exposed end of a vertical layer of rock slowly weathers and breaks away.      2. While there is very little left of the layer that fell, its source from the wall has in turn exposed another thinner, weaker layer, which has suffered more weathering and fracturing than the layer which used to enclose it.  The end of that thinner layer appears relatively stable at present, though it will eventually come down.       3. There is, therefore, a long-term safety hazard remaining, one perhaps comparable to the long term hazard remaining on Middle Brother.  The hazard cannot be removed effectively or safely by blasting or other rock removal from the cliff face, because the hazard rocks do not present a clean, clear target.       4. Closure for about two weeks to allow settling and adjustments in the source area area will help confirm longer term stability.      5. Work on the trail will begin after that period to clean up the trail for summer use.  The trail could be opened to the public by Memorial Day weekend.  The closure need not be manned except during work hours on the trail when blasting or movement of large rocks create extra risks to others in the area...  The rock fall was reported by a Swedish couple who watched it from above the impact area.  They were at first in awe of what they saw.  Only a little later, when they heard screams from people below caught in the dust and rock fragments, did they call on a cell phone.  Their call was received by Park Dispatch at 13:05.  Of the three injuries by flyrock, the most serious was a cut on the head of one young man who, though he never lost consciousness, thought the rock that grazed him was about the size of a football…. The Swedish couple later told McKenzie that the rock fall looked ""like a large column"" dropping from the face of the cliff, followed by lots of dust.  It is not possible to determine a trigger for the event.  There have been no recent earthquakes that can be related to the rock fall.  Weather contributed to the failure.  No doubt the series of wetter than normal winters since 1995 accelerated weathering processes.  Weather during the month before the rock fall however, does not provide an explanation for the particular time of the event.  Between 31 March and 11 April, the weather in Yosemite Valley was cold with low temperatures at or below freezing every night, with 2.55 inches [6.48 cm] of rain and 30 inches [76.2 cm] of snow on the Valley floor spread over the period.  High temperatures were under 51 degrees F, usually in the 40's, sometimes the 30's during this period.  That was followed by a dry, warming spell during which temperatures quickly rose with lows in the 40's after April 14 and highs in the 70's.  Freezing and thawing was occurring at the source area (about 6,600 feet elevation) on April 12 through 14, but not after that when the line of freezing temperatures rose well above the valley rims... Varied weather patterns--sun and rain, clear and cloudy, warm and cold--fed the fluctuating drainage behind and through the failed block.  That block seems to have been free but for several attachments on its south or valley side.  There was a great deal of soil behind it penetrated by large, long, mature roots coming from live oaks on the cliff above.  Much of the exposed soil was washed away in the light rains of April 23 and 25, preceding our evaluation.  Temperature, water, soil, and roots were the common elements contributing to this failure.  They had worked together to weaken the hold on this small block until it finally failed.  The size of the block cannot be exactly calculated.  A generous allowance for the irregularly-shaped block would be 12 x 15 x 4 feet, or about 27 cubic yards, weighing around 63 tons.  Rock structure has played a key role in continuing rock fall in this part of the Upper Falls gully.  Standing above the trail and projecting from the cliff face are a number of layers or strata in the rock.  Those vertical layers are separated by joints running approximately northeast-southwest, exposed by a million years of weathering to project from the cliff."""

The rock fall occurred in two parts. The impact from one generated the other, leaving behind a conchoidal-shaped fracture on the lower source.  The pattern of distribution of rock onto the talus was similar to that of the 16 November 1998 event, but covering a smaller area.  Rock did not travel nearly as far, the farthest rocks traveling about 500 feet.  Similarly, the zone of airborne splatter was confined to a smaller area on the talus.... No well-defined trigger for the 25 May event could be assigned, for there had been only a trace of rain several days before and no observed seismicity in the Yosemite Valley.  Likewise ambient temperature change during the day is not a logical trigger for these rock falls since the timing of the events does not fit a clearly defined pattern.""     (2)  Matasci et al.

The travel of rocks along the talus and airborne splatter of rock was again very similar to the previous observed distributions, extending to nearly the limits of the 16 November 1998 event [see ID 1998111602].  Some of these airborne splatter pieces reached the tent cabins and, falling at steep angles, pierced the canvas tops, broke beams, and fell to the floor.  Two of the larger projectiles, approximately the size of a football, pierced the canvas roofs of Tents 28 and 36.""    (2)  From American Alpine Club (2000):   ""After climbing in the Valley for a couple of weeks, Peter Terbush (22), Joseph Kewin (21), and Kerry Pyle (20) were nearing the end of their vacation.  On June 13, in late afternoon, they decided to climb Apron Jam, a one pitch, 5.9 crack near the west end of Glacier Point Apron.  Pyle led the pitch while Terbush belayed at the base and Kewin lounged beside him.  Just after 7:30 pm, as Pyle was finishing the pitch, he heard a loud rumble above, and, within a second or two, boulders the size of Volkswagons were flying by to his right.  He scrambled the last few feet to the belay (a pair of bolts), clipped in two quickdraws, and began forming a clove hitch in his rope, as a tie in.  Before he could finish, rock fragments slammed into his head.  He dropped the rope and simply grabbed the quickdraws and pressed himself against the wall.  He grew faint and nauseous from the blows but hung on and survived.  Without a helmet, he received severe scalp lacerations, but no other major injuries.  As the rock fall ceased, he noticed that his lead rope was still snug, and called down to his friends.  Kewin responded that he was OK but that Terbush might be dead.  When the rock fall began, Kewin scrambled several feet east to get out of the way, and, like Pyle, hugged the wall.  After the noise stopped, he went back to Terbush and found him unresponsive and pulseless.  Terbush had not moved from his original position; in fact, he was still holding Pyle's rope as if on belay.  Kewin removed the rope from Terbush's hands so that Pyle could use it to rappel, then he ran down to the parking lot for help.  One ranger arrived a few minutes later and confirmed that Terbush had received fatal head injuries.  The National Park Service delayed bringing Terbush out until it could assess the risk of more rock fall.  On the 14th, National Park Service and U.S. Geological Survey specialists examined the source area by helicopter and telescope; despite a couple of very small rock falls that day, they permitted a ground team to make the recovery on the 15th.""    (3)  From Wieczorek and Snyder (1999):  ""The peak of runoff of the Merced River in late May and early June suggests that the two rock falls of 25 May and 13 June 1999 were possibly related to the buildup of pressures in joints from infiltration and fracture flow from spring snowmelt [at Glacier Point], but it is not possible to better substantiate the timing nor the magnitude of the cleft pressures.  The timing of the initial 16 November 1998 rock fall does not fit the pattern of influence from spring snowmelt; however, it does fit the freeze-thaw pattern of early winter storms with temperatures alternating above and below freezing in the days preceding the event."" [Subsequent monitoring of seepage at the source area showed a greater degree of correlation with precipitation events rather than snowmelt.  1.3 cm of precipitation, in the form of snow, fell at Glacier Point on 3 June 1999 and subsequently melted over the next several days, providing a possible source of seepage observed at the source area following the 13 June 1999 rock fall.]    (4)  Matasci et al. (2011) performed structural analyses of the rock-fall source area using ground-based laser scanning (LiDAR) and computer software for measuring joint orientations and assessing slope stability.     (5)  Crack propagation following the 13 June 1999 rock fall was analyzed by Chau and Lin (2011) and found to most likely relate to high horizontal stresses within the cliff.     (6)  The fatality resulting from this rock fall precipitated a lawsuit against the National Park Service (Terbush vs. United States) in 2001, in which Plaintiffs argued that the National Park Service failed to properly warn the climbers of the hazard, and that the National Park Service triggered the rock fall by allowing water to overflow from a water supply tank upslope of the Glacier Point parking lot.  Plaintiffs argued that rock fractures directed this water to the cliff, triggering the rock fall by elevating cleft pressures behind an exfoliation slab.  The water-system triggering hypothesis was presented in Watters et al. (2007) and Watts et al. (2007).  The case was dismissed by the U.S. District Court (Eastern District of California, Fresno Branch) in 2005, appealed to the 9th Circuit Court, partially remanded to the District Court in 2008 to address remaining issues of maintenance, and dismissed again by the District Court in 2010.   The water-system triggering hypothesis was evaluated by Stock et al. (2012b) and shown to be highly unlikely based on the frequency of rock falls at Glacier Point, complex fracture patterns, lack of timing correlation, and the vastly larger quantities of water produced by local snowmelt."

She ran down the trail for cover behind a large rock, yelling to two backpackers to do the same.  Of the two, the woman received a minor head injury as she was grazed by rock, as well as a leg abrasion.  The man's camcorder was hit by rock.  Noreen called the rock fall in to Park Dispatch at 7:20 a.m. while it was still happening.  Trail supervisor Tim Ludington and Jim Snyder inspected the trail soon afterwards, also locating the source area high above on the Panorama Cliffs.  The thin sheet of rock that fell broke up many times against the cliff as it fell a little over a thousand feet to the Nevada Falls Horse Trail.  The switchbacks at Valley  View (western-most switchback corner on the trail) acted as catch basins for the falling and flying debris.  The trail was covered with rock and live oak branches cut down by falling rock.  The largest rock on the trail from the rock fall was about 3 x 3 x 4 feet , showing that the failed sheet had broken up thoroughly on the way down.  The rock fall knocked out top courses on 60 to 80 feet of trail wall.  Falling rock moved several larger rocks formerly on the inside of the trail down on to the trail itself.  The trail will be cleared for administrative use while reconstruction occurs.  The trail will probably be reopened without restriction in about a month.  The source area was on a sheer cliff at about 6,100 feet elevation.  I [Snyder] flew the source area [by helicopter] to examine it closely.  The failed block was probably around 25 feet high and 20 feet wide to judge from nearby vegetation.  The sheet was quite thin but up to three or four feet thick along a vertical axis.  Its failure left a small roof defined like the bottom of the sheet by a horizontal joint set.  There were no new cracks around the source to suggest further failures from this point in the near future.  The source area was dirty and had been penetrated deeply by roots from a nearby shrub (not a live oak).  The long, fine root mass from this low-growing shrub had extended far behind the failed sheet but now hung down below the source, swinging in the breeze.  There was no moisture in the source area.  The 0.08 inches [0.2 cm] of rain in a thunderstorm on the early morning of 10 August 1999 may not have contributed to the rock fall.  Volume of the failed sheet was probably between 37 and 56 cubic yards (87 and 131 tons).  The rock fall had heavy impacts on the cliff, grinding and powdering, rather that breaking, rock.  The steep but bulging cliff had the effect of spreading the rock fall east and west as it broke, strafing the trail and forest with flyrock over a considerable area.  Impacts below the cliff on the trail and talus moved a great deal of other material downslope.  One old fir showed four other flyrock scars in addition to a new one from this rock fall.  While a couple of scars may have come from trail work, the orientation of all the scars indicated earlier rock fall from sources in the same general area.  When the sheet failed, it dropped to a sloping ledge covered with other rock, soil, and vegetation.  At the back of this ledge was a large block, partially pulled away from the cliff to leave a deep, narrow slot behind, into which the failed slab fell.  While much of it stayed in the slot, more of it fell out to the ledge before falling down the cliff face.  On the ledge are several fragments of the slab, one of them perhaps 10 feet square. That fragment hit the soil flat and moved downhill a few feet before stopping.  Another smaller piece remains perched on the edge, partly in dirt and partly on bedrock, with a lot of friction preventing its immediate slippage.  There are many smaller chunks of broken rock on the ledge, but they are on dirt and other rock rather than on the very edge of the ledge.  Since the ledge material has been loosened by rock fall, however, there will be some danger of small material slipping off this fall season.  Winds may move some rock by blowing loosened, supporting soil away.  Rains will certainly initiate some movement of loose material on the ledge, especially when ledge soils become saturated.  Any danger from immediate rock fall from this area, then, comes not from the source area, which appears clean, but from the sloping ledge underneath it.  Workers on the trail should be aware of this potential.  Information about the potential for small rock fall should also be made available to hikers, perhaps through trail condition reports, once the trail reopens for general use."""

Workers on the El Portal Road heard rock fall above them and ran for cover.  They saw one rock hit the steep cliff above another larger rock come off the cliff top.  The rocks that made it to the road were described as two to four feet in size.  One the size of ""a car engine"" hit the hood of an explosives truck.  Another, falling from a different track off the cliff above, made an impact crater in the outside road shoulder.  There were no injuries, but the event was a frightening demonstration of the vulnerability of the roadway to even small rock fall from far above.  At about 3:30 p.m. we checked the source area by helicopter.  We could see one larger impact point roughly halfway down the cliff and other smaller impacts from the resulting splatter.  Finding the source was difficult, however, since it was far above the location observed from the road.  At length we located the rock's track through brush and grass, following it to the small source area about 1,700 feet above the road.  The source was located on a map and photographed, but the source area was too small in an area cluttered with brush and other rocks to (be) observed clearly by air.  To make a better evaluation of its safety and stability, we resolved to hike in for a closer look.  In the meantime the El Portal Road was closed to through traffic in case more material came down.  On the morning of 9 February, Mike Shenton and Brian Ward from Trails hiked in from Foresta with Jim Snyder to the source area.  Finding the small source on a steep brush-covered slope was slow, but close observation of the source helped answer questions about how the rock fall had occurred and about its stability.  The size of the failed block was approximately 5 feet high, six feet across, and four feet through.  It was irregularly shaped.  Numerous fractures within it had been weathered through.  With only a small attachment at its rear, the block sat atop a 3 x 3 x 1 feet plate that stood upright in soft grassy soil.  As the block failed, it pulled the lower plate out, which had the effect of throwing the larger block, giving it an initial velocity it might not have otherwise had.  The smaller plate ploughed into the soft earth some 40 feet below the source.  The larger block broke into several pieces along weathered fracture lines to create a corridor of closely braided tracks down the steep (33-35 degree) slope.  The slope has many outcrops of rock set in soft soils, moist but not wet while we were there, into which our boots sank ankle deep.  The soil absorbed much of the force of the descending rock.  Some of that force was also transferred to other rocks dislodged from their perches and sent down the hill.  The larger rocks slid, rolled, bounded to careen down the steep hillside through soft soil and brush, hitting many obstructions and changing paths.  A hundred feet below the source, the largest rock knocked over a burned cedar snag three feet in diameter.  A hundred feet below that, the rock plowed through a down log and knocked over a twelve-inch live oak.  Some of the loosened rocks and pieces doubtless came to rest before reaching the cliff some 700 feet away from the source area.  Several of the larger rocks did not, although their paths were so altered by obstacles that they appeared to come off the cliff from different locations.  Once they reached the cliff edge, they could gain velocity unimpeded in their down-slope plunge, except for impacts against the wall.  The source area is relatively stable.  The remaining block is fractured and the fractures penetrated by roots and dirt.  The exposed rock on this slope is all very weathered.  Some of it shows signs of slight movement in the last several years.  The minor movement of one larger rock appeared related to the storms that produced the 1997 flood.  The slope has been developed by much weathering and movement over a period of a million years or more.  Its deep soils and rounded, broken rock discolored by chemical change all show the length and depth of this containing process.  We could not determine the exact trigger of this particular rock fall even though contributing factors to it were much in evidence.  First, there was very little freshly broken rock.  The failure occurred along very weathered fracture lines.  One fine fracture was partly broken through with signs of discoloring from oxidation, while other wider breaks were filled with dirt and roots.  Only one part of the final break was fresh.  Second, roots of live oak and particularly poison oak had penetrated the slowly crumbling block throughout.  There were mats of small poison oak roots at the bottom of the source and one large root, 1.5 inches diameter, growing through one side of the failed block.  Third were several large burn scars deep inside the failed rock.  These scars formed during the 1990 Foresta fire when fire followed existing roots to smolder deep inside the rock.  The thick poison oak root had sprouted after the fire to reclaim its burned territory.  While the regrowth of that rootstock acted to widen and weather older fractures, heat from the fire certainly contributed to weakening the rock along weathered fractures as well.  Fourth, the rains of the previous ten days probably contributed to the failure.  There had been some minor drainage around the rock, overturning small rock fragments.  There was some seepage through and behind the rock shown by small ferns growing at the base of the source underneath the former failed overhang.  A combination of these factors contributed to the failure.  All of them relate to the processes of weathering, but none of them can be singled out as the trigger for the 8 February rock fall.  There was a blast by the contractor on the El Portal Road called in to National Park Service Park Dispatch at 11:48 a.m., about thirty minutes prior to the rock fall.  Though coincidental, we do not believe there is relationship between the blast and the subsequent rock fall.  The blast was quite small, a cleanup shot of ""a few sticks"" in a road cut rather than bedrock.  The blast was also about 2,500 feet away from the source area."""

A photographer along the river and Leidig Meadow heard occasional smaller rocks after 7:30 am but paid no attention.  A Yosemite Concession Services bus passed through Northside Drive just 15 seconds ahead of the rock fall at 08:36; passengers saw and heard it behind them.  The photographer dropped his camera bag full of gear and ran for cover behind a tree, unharmed except for an intestinal source triggered by the sudden, frightening event.  In the Research Library on the second floor of the concrete and rock Museum Building about 1.3 miles east, I [Snyder] heard the rock fall and felt the impact shock waves from the source, checked with Park Dispatch, and left for the scene of the event.  The source from about 5,600 feet was clearly visible from the Ranger Club ""Y"" on Northside Drive; dust was still rising from the source area and talus... Conclusions on failure sizes remain problematic.  Cliff features can be roughly calculated from the 7.5' Half Dome topographic map which shows the cliff pretty clearly.  By applying the height of cliff features to older Search and Rescue photographs of the cliff taken in the 1970's, I [Snyder] derived an estimated height of 224 feet for the 22 February 2000 failure.  Width and thickness, however, were difficult to pin down since there was great variation in the block.  After numerous calculations I settled on a width of 87 feet and a thickness varying up to 37 feet.  The resulting estimate of the failure, with adjustments for varying shape, was 22,843 cubic yards or about 55,206 tons (for the earlier failure)."""

They were in the middle of the rock fall area when at 08:55, another rock fall occurred.  They alternately ran and fell trying to get away; they were unharmed but shaken.  This second smaller source came from a flake hit hard by the first rock fall.  Following this second source, other smaller rock fall continued to occur in a random manner.  Northside Drive had to remain closed as long as there was instability.  … Roadblocks were established at El Capitan Bridge and at Camp 4, Leidig Meadow cordoned off, and rock fall monitors posted near the trail crossing of Northside Drive below Camp 4.  Weather contributed to this rock fall but cannot be assigned as its trigger.  The winter in Yosemite had been dry before January with warm spells and little freezing on the Valley floor.  January brought several storms and temperatures around freezing at the Valley floor elevation.  Snowlines fluctuated  between 5,000 and 6,500 feet.  A relatively warm storm came through between 10-17 February (6.18 inches [15.7 cm] of rain) and another small storm on 20-21 February (0.66 inches [1.68 cm]  of rain) with snowlines near the source.  22 February was clear with a low temperature of 33 degrees Fahrenheit on the valley floor.  Temperatures had been freezing at the source before 22 February, but the storm had stopped hours before morning.  Although 22 February was clear, stormy weather returned on 23 February.  These new storms, with one break on 26 February, brought frequent snow to the valley floor and lasted into 1 March.  These storms generated small rock fall from ledge bound debris below the 22 February source.  Low snowlines in these storms suggest a period of sustained freezing and thawing at the elevations of the source.  This period of storm and temperature fluctuation was the probable trigger for a larger rock fall on March 1 from a source area approximately 600 feet east of the 22 February source.  Using the height of the first block for comparison allowed a calculation of the smaller second 22 February block as 52 cubic yards or about 124 tons."""

While the noise of the rock fall woke me up, many others in the area also felt the impact of it up to 1.5 miles east of the source.  Visitors at Yosemite Lodge and campers in Camp 4 were jarred awake by the event, which sounded as if it was almost on top of them.  Although no one heard or felt this rock  fall as anything but a single event, the seismic record indicated two rock falls about 10 seconds apart, the second two to three times larger than the first (Robert Norris, U.S. Geological Survey, commun., 2 March 2000). This rock fall was obviously larger than the 22 February event, clearing a greater area of woods off the talus cone below the climbing route called ""The Folly"" and sending more rock farther across Northside Drive.  The closure was moved east closer to Camp 4, while monitoring continued.  Trying to use 22 February block figures as ratios for the 1 March failure on both photographs and maps was marginally successful.  I concluded, with uncertainty, that the 1 March failure was about 245 feet high, 182 feet wide and averaged 20 feet thick.  With adjustments for variations in shape and thickness, I [Snyder] arrived at a ballpark figure of 27,068 cubic yards or 63,949 tons.  I [Snyder] checked rock fall lines following each event.  Talus or larger rock extended to or lay behind base of talus lines mapped by the US Geological Survey (Wieczorek et al., 1999).  The 1 March rock fall reached the (talus) line because it fell directly to it, more or less unobstructed.  The 22 February rock fall generally stayed behind the line.  Falling as it did on the east side of the Rocky Point talus cone, it was deflected in that direction.  Flyrock followed the talus patterns of these two rock falls… Unlike the Curry Village rock falls which produced a mix of smaller sizes of flyrock down to a couple inches, flyrock from the 22 February and 1 March rock falls was much larger and more dispersed... Flyrock [from the 1 March rock fall] ranged in size from about 0.25 to 3.75 cubic feet and travelled as far as 300 feet beyond the road toward the river.  Flyrock [from 22 February rock fall] ranged from one-quarter to about 2 cubic feet and does not seem to have gone more than about 120 feet beyond the road.  The differences in distance are related to breakage on the way down, restraint on intervening ledges midway, angles of the cliffs along which the rocks fell, and conformations of the distant talus cones.  While most larger pieces of the 1 March flyrock tended southeast from the talus some smaller flyrock of softball size and somewhat larger went into the west end of the old Indian village.  The only rock fall I know in Yosemite Valley for which the agency of pore water pressure can be shown was the Middle Brother failure of 1 March 2000, for which a photograph shows previously trapped water dispersing across the new face shortly after the failure and despite freezing temperatures on the cliff face and Valley floor...  Road reopening was recommended after road repairs were completed.  We suggested that the ""No Stopping Next 1/4 Mile/Rock Slide Area"" signs be changed to say ""1/2 Mile"" and be moved to further east on Northside Drive.  Recognizing that spring conditions with storms and runoff could bring more changes in the sources, it was decided initially to reopen the road Thursday, 23 March 2000.  An administrative decision to leave the road closed for the Secretary of the Interior's announcement of the Draft Yosemite Valley Plan and press conference in Yosemite Valley postponed the actual opening to Thursday, 30 March 2000 so the press could see two-way traffic on Southside Drive."""

Northside Drive was closed while the rock fall source area was evaluated.  The rock fall followed a brief storm on 16-17 May  which delivered 0.60 inches (1.52 cm).  The rock fall had clearly come from the top of the 22 February 2000 source.  The 22 February 2000 failure was mostly from more massive though weathered rock.  At the top of the source is a horizontal joint, well penetrated by roots, above which are finely-jointed, well weathered rock.  These have been unloading a little at a time almost continuously through decades past.  A 1970's Search and Rescue photo (#5283) shows an open area there and wide white marks down the cliff scraped clean by falling rocks.  The 17 May failure appears to have been a long slab lying just above more massive rock on the cliff.  This slab was overlaid by more weathered, highly jointed rock surrounded by roots with mud underneath and behind.  The slab pulled away and brought some of the more weathered rock with it.  Altogether the failure may have been as much as 18.5 cubic yards or about 44 tons, though these crude estimates are problematic and probably high.  The road was closed for 24 hours while the source was monitored.  No further rock fall occurred, but the closure was extended to 48 hours … the road reopened at 10:00 on Friday 19 May instead.  In checking this rock fall, I [Snyder] found that the failed rock was largely swallowed up by the cliff, its ledges, and the Rocky Point talus cone.

Jim Tucker and I accompanied Patricia to her original vantage point, from which she provided a positive location for the rock fall on the cliff.  From her observations we could see that the small rock fall came from the east end of the 13 June 1999 source area and that it fell on the east end of the large underlying ledge through a slightly wet drainage there.  From that point the rock cascaded down the ramped cliff to the talus below.  Observation of the source with the Questar an hour later revealed no specific source.  At the east end of the 13 June source, however, there are several thin, broken slabs of rock.  These flakes were left from the 13 June 1999 failure, and some fell again on 14 July 1999 from that point.  There is still some loose material there, but it is not large and is not an indicator of anything larger waiting to come down.  There are no new, extended, or changed cracks around that part of the source area to indicate increased rock fall potential from it.  This small rock fall did not come from the cracking blocks which have been under observation for a full year now...  On June 15 I hiked to the top of the talus cone to locate evidence of the rock fall.  There were several new small blocks of less than two cubic feet each with small fresh dust and impact marks.  These travelled no more than 150 feet from the cliff face.  Small as they were, these blocks did not initiate flyrock.  Patches of open dirt in the talus allowed tracking of the flyrock which travelled about 225 feet from the cliff face.  These patterns fit the patterns of talus and flyrock from the other three Curry Village rock falls and from the several Middle Brother rock falls this spring.  That pattern is that the larger the rock fall the greater the distance travelled by large rock and flyrock, conditioned by the conformation of the cliff face and talus beneath.  The rock that fell, since it came from the east side of the source, was funneled through the east side of the ledge below it. On the talus the falling rock was directed roughly northeast, largely away from the Terrace.  The rock seemed to follow prominent lines of fall toward the northeast in both the 16 November 1998 and 13 June 2000 rock falls….  Because the rock fall was small, with no impact to nearby facilities, there was no closure or evacuation of any of Curry Village.  It was so obviously small and unthreatening that YCS employees in Terrace housing took the event in stride, even though they are all prepared to implement evacuation procedures in a larger rock fall emergency..."""

Flyrock reached the upper part of Curry Village which was closed for observation.  Guest accommodations were reopened at noon, 1 September, for the Labor Day weekend.  While generally within the patterns of earlier flyrock, the impacts of this rock fall were noticeably different.  Normally a smaller rock fall would not reach far down the talus slope.  In this case, one five-to ten-ton boulder exploded on impact to send a fan of larger flyrock into closed accommodations, emphasizing the unpredictability of rock fall.  Regular observations of the cliff above Curry Village since 15 June 1999 also suggest very subtle rock movement on the cliff face as well as unexplained changes in subsurface drainage in and around the source areas... Ranger noted occupants of the Terrace and guest tents quickly self-evacuated before the area was cordoned off for evaluation.  Information about the range of flyrock was used to establish a safe area and closure.  The cliff face was monitored by YCS Security for noise signifying further activity…. YCS Security reported small popping noises at 5:06 and 6:52 a.m., 30 August 2000.  No further noise was reported from the source area. …Since there was no further rock fall, the closure was lifted about noon, 1 September, as the Labor Day weekend began….  The 29 August 2000, failure followed very generally the patterns of earlier Curry Village failures from the same source by landing within the area we thought would contain a failure of the observed weak formation.  The 29 August rock fall was small in comparison with earlier Curry events.  It began as a roughly triangular block of about 11 feet high, nearly 20 feet long, and approximately 5 feet thick.  The failure consisted of about 20 cubic yards weighing about 48 tons (dimensions were measured from scaled photographs of the 13 June 1999 source.  Small and coming from an unexpected source, the 29 August failure nevertheless did send a very few pieces of flyrock into parts of Curry Village where it was not expected.  The flyrock pattern of this size rock fall clearly did not replicate flyrock patterns established in earlier rock fall...  There seems no way to easily explain the 29 August failure or to discover a trigger or immediate cause for it.  There had been no temperatures near freezing at the source.  There had been no rainfall before the failure, although there was 0.09 inches [0.23 cm] the day following, 0.05 inches [0.13 cm] on 1 September, and 0.45 inches [1.14 cm] on 2 September.  The Curry Village source was over 95% dry when observed 28 Augus and again on 30 August.  The source was 90% dry on 1 September, a slight change following light showers.  There was some seepage with fine brown soil visible behind the failed block on 30 August, and there were also some fine roots visible in the back of the new source.  Seepage along the joint parallel to the cliff face (J1) covered about 30% of the new source as observed the morning of 30 August by helicopter.  This seepage was apparently pre-existing, to judge from similar seepage along the same joint immediately east, and not the result of a source of water stored in a closed joint.  A cause for this source cannot be clearly assigned to earthquake, freeze-thaw, storms, runoff, pore water pressure, or vegetation penetration.  From the weak formation under observation, the block(s) fell toward the large horizontal ledge which has been a catch basin for much Curry rock fall since November 1998.  The blocks hit a previously hammered slab just above the ledge, breaking up part of it by impact, perhaps 200 tons of additional rock.  Most of this new rock landed on the broad ledge less than 30 feet below.  The ledge held most of the falling rock, including some large slabs.  The pile of debris on the ledge was sufficiently disturbed that dirt was washing out the ledge center during the 1 September 2000 rain.  Some rock went over the ledge and down the long, glaciated ramp into the talus.  There was relatively little dust with the 29 August 2000 failure.  Dust in quantities enough to leave a film on the ground and on tent frames reached only into the closed top portion of the Terrace to about Tent 30.  There was very little larger rock in evidence on the talus and few new impacts in the talus, mostly near the top of the cone.  There were, however, a couple of two-inch flyrock pieces above the Wilderness Parking Lot east of Curry Village.  A baseball-size piece of flyrock went through the canvas roof of closed Tent 247 to bounce and roll out toward Tent 340 on the west.  In the middle, a rock the size of a football went through Tent 327, coming to rest outside Tent 325 just across from it.  There was a report of flyrock near Cabin 214 and the pool, but with several efforts we could find neither flyrock nor impacts anywhere in that vicinity.  Behind this wide scattering of smaller flyrock was a more restricted area hit by larger flyrock of a half cubic foot or more.  Flyrock this size entered the closed upper section of the Terrace, damaging about 10 tent frames without canvas and coming to rest on several others.  Larger flyrock also came to rest in the talus behind the back row of guest tents 326-347.  Talus there provided catch basins for this flyrock.  Still, this was larger flyrock farther down the slope than we had seen following any of the earlier, much larger rock falls.  Examining the talus slope on 5 September  2000, photographer Michael Dixon and Snyder were puzzled by the lack of new rock or impact craters on the talus.  We could find no pattern in the erratic paths of flyrock.  Nearly all the new vegetation that had grown up following the 13 June 1999 failure remained undamaged.  But close to the west edge of the new 1998-1999 opening on the talus cone was a single new track of a block bounding down the slope.  There were sliding marks and impact craters perhaps 30 feet apart in a line down the slope.  While the size of the craters may be a poor source of information about the size of the rock, we could guess that it may have been four to five feet in diameter, weighing five to ten tons.  The track ended in the larger talus just inside the trees.  Surrounded by large rocks from the 16 November 1998 and other rock fall was one large rock hit directly on top by the new block racing down the slope.  The impact popped the SUV-size rock into three pieces.  The falling rock exploded on impact, sending the flyrock out in a large fan. … Distribution of larger flyrock shows how flyrock fanned out from this one point of impact.  The impact location helps explain the anomaly of a smaller rock fall generating larger flyrock outside the patterns established by earlier and larger rock fall from the Curry Village source area.  The flyrock came not from the size of the rock fall but from one particular block's chance impact with another in talus."""

He looked up above the Ledge Trail to see a block falling.  He heard it hit with a loud explosion noted into the campgrounds and saw a dust plume rise.  He saw a few rocks come over the edge in the vicinity of Staircase Falls but found no impacts in Curry Village.  A medical callout simultaneous with the rock fall alert indicated the possibility of injuries.  Valley District rangers responded, finding no rock fall damage or injuries.  The rock fall was noisy and raised a dust cloud on the big ledge above Curry Village and Staircase Falls.  As Linda Abbott's photograph shows, rock fall impact sent dust down the ledge while rising warm air and impact also carried dust into LeConte Gully.  Dust and viewpoints close under the ledge made the source difficult to locate from the ground. ... A reconnaissance flight with the experienced eyes of Helitack crew leader Karen Kufta enabled us to locate the source and check the rock fall track.  We saw no sign of people on the ledge in the impact area.  That afternoon we checked the talus behind Curry Village and discovered that rock fall and flyrock had reached about 600 feet away and 250 feet elevation above the nearest Curry Village accommodations.  We were unable to find any new rock on the ledges of Staircase Falls.  Further rock fall was reported by a geological tour group led by U.S. Geological Survey King Huber at 3 am, 16 August 2001.  Though a location could not be determined, the new Ledge Trail source was the most likely source, for there was some loose rock hanging just below the new source.  On 21 August we checked both the Curry and Ledge Trail source areas, finding no new cracks or signs of movement.  The failed sheet is in the shape of a backwards ""L"" outlined in the appended photograph.  Proportional to the helicopter, the size of the source's bottom panel was roughly ten feet high, fifteen feet across, and two feet thick.  Using this rough gauge to estimate remaining source areas, the total source can be calculated at about 17 cubic yards or about 40 tons.  Fresh dirt at the top of the source suggests the presence of a weathered overlaying plate.  Thickness of all these plates appears to have been 2-2.5 feet, though there may have been thicker bulge toward the source top.  The overlaying slab was weathered at the edges and underneath.  Possibly, it failed first, triggering the failure of the large sheet beneath it.  Beyond this, no trigger for this rock fall can be determined.  The backwards ""L"" frames a large plate roughly ten feet square and two feet thick--approximately 7.5 cubic yards or 17.5 tons.  Several old longitudinal cracks run through it.  These cracks have some vegetation in them and seepage has left stains of caliche issuing from them.  No fresh movement, shear, or chipping along these cracks is apparent.  Nevertheless, when the foundation of a sheet is removed by rock fall, the possibility for a later failure above the new source can be increased.  If this remaining slab does fall, it will be smaller and follow the same track as the 15 August failure.  It will be noisy and dusty but should not endanger any part of Curry Village.  [for descriptions of the future failures at this site, see the 14 September 2001 and 25 September 2001 events listed as ID 2001091401 and ID 2001092502].  Whatever the trigger may have been, the failed slabs scraped their way down a very steeply inclined ramp 30-40 feet long before free-falling to a small buttress at the foot of the cliff face.  There they exploded on impact, clearing out a little less than an acre of vegetation.  Some rock remained in the area of impact, but much of it flowed down three parallel paths on the ledge, taking other loose rock with it.  The ledge has several furrows, weathered vertical joints, which drain the ledge but also support a thin forest of live oak.  Shattered rock bounded down these naturally weathered paths along the ledge.  One joint furrow closest to the cliff becomes a gully which makes a turn around the edge of the open cliff to run toward the Knob Hill showerhouse at Curry Village.  This gully has been the source of numerous debris flows, sometimes rock fall-driven, impacting the showerhouse in February 1986 (ID 1986021801).  The showerhouse was rebuilt and a diversion wall above it made with debris-flow material.  Swift-moving rock fall cut down many live oaks and one tall fir, while locking loose other debris on the ledge.  Some rock stopped above and on the ledge.  A few pieces made it around the gully turn and down toward the showerhouse.  Some rock also crossed the gully at the turn.  One block about five feet cubed left a clear track through the woods before coming to rest in the big talus about 600 feet above the Foster Curry cabin.  This large block seems not to have come from the rock fall but to have been hit and sent down the mountain by it.  Rock from the rock fall loosened much of the eastern wall of the gully with impacts, initiating the movement of many other rocks, and destroyed some of the remaining old Ledge Trail at the gully crossing.

(2003),"(1) According to Jim Snyder (written commun., 1 November 2001):  ""On Friday night, 14 September 2001, rock fall occurred about 10:45 pm followed by a larger, noisier rock fall at about 11:45 pm, lasting nearly a minute.  The second rock fall awakened many in Curry Village and the campgrounds, but darkness precluded seeing anything.  Rangers and Curry Village personnel checked the area behind Curry for fresh rock.  They saw dust but found no fresh rock and heard no further rock fall.  Therefore, they decided it was safe enough to leave the facility open. … There is no indication of a possible trigger for this event.  No new or widened cracks or weaknesses were outwardly visible following the 15 August 2001 event (ID 2001081501).  However, that first event must have stressed or destabilized material around it, for the second source nearly surrounded the first.  The slabs that failed on 14 September abutted the 15 August source and nearly surrounded it.  Though calculations are very crude, the 14 September rock fall appears to have been roughly three times the area of the 15 August source, or in the range of 120-150 tons.  Most of the newly failed slab was thin - two or three feet through at the most - but the upper west side of it may have been as thick as six feet.  This upper west side, framed by a local joint pattern, was also more weathered and dirtier than the rest of the unusually clean and bright source.  No seepage had been visible in the source, and there had been no rain before this source during this unusually dry season.  The 14 September failure generally followed the pattern in falling established in the 15 August event.  There were some significant differences, however, especially that larger rock traveled farther and apparently faster on 14 September, and that some rock jumped the ledge between the gully and Staircase Fall.  It is likely that the 15 August event cleared the track along the Ledge Trail for its 14 September successor.  Most rock on 14 September took the several deeply weathered vertical joints on the ledge.  Live oaks, some pines, and some obstructing rock from earlier rock falls have been removed or destabilized, affording less resistance to this latest rock fall.  On 14 September, some rock went over the ledge about half way between the gully and Staircase Fall, where a thick forest with deeper duff tended to absorb it.  A few pieces of this rock reached to within about 425 feet of Tent 67 and CV90A-B west of the gully.  Most rock, however, traveled down the weathered vertical joints to the gully itself.  There some of it had piled up.  Other rocks bounded across the gully to head east, a few two cubic foot blocks getting as far as the talus above the Foster Curry Cabin, a hundred feet or more below the farthest rock there from the 15 August rock fall.  On 14 September, quite a few pieces of rock slammed into the gully wall at the gully's turn around the eastern end of the broad ledge, where the old Ledge Trail used to cross the gully.  Rocks of up to ten tons, formerly parts of the gully wall, were knocked out and sent down the channel a few feet.  Impacts from the new rock loosened much of the channel and added to quantities of rock moving downhill.  But the new rock was moving fastest.  Some of it was bounding down the gully toward the showerhouse, cutting off 8-inch thick big leaf maples 15 feet in the air 500 feet above the showerhouse.  With each impact, these blocks broke up a little more and showered the area within 50 feet of impact with smaller flyrock.  The lowest group of large rock came to rest in the gully channel about 330 feet above the showerhouse.  A single rock of about half a ton cartwheeled past this point, taking about 25 feet with each bounce until it dug into an old trail to former tent platforms 75 feet east of the gully, about 85 feet above uppermost tents 69 and 70, and about 160 feet above the showerhouse.  The breaking up of the thin falling plate, then its rush along previously opened tracks, probably made possible such a long run toward the Curry Village tents. The gully guided much of the falling rock, but the rough character of the channel acted simultaneously to retard and hold most of the large moving fragments.  It could be that the bedrock of the big ledge, little cluttered with talus, acted to accelerate material falling in the first two rock falls.  It is interesting that such relatively small events could send material so far downslope by a circuitous path.  The tracking of rock fall from the Ledge Trail is clearly quite different from tracking rock fall from Curry Village source where the long, lower angle talus cone beneath the source area greatly slows rock fall progress.""

The storm arrived in Yosemite about 1 am September 25 and continued energetically until morning.  About 0.30 inches [0.76 cm] of rain fell, occasionally hard.  The lightning storm generated some 27 new fires while the rain cleared the air from the old ones.  The storm initiated at least two rock falls heard about 4:30 am, one from the Panorama Cliff above the Nevada Falls Horse Trail and another from the new source over the Ledge Trail above Curry Village.…  Campers, Curry Village guests, and employees alike heard the rock fall but could not clearly place it. …With help from SAR, the trail was closed at 1:45 pm until sufficient trail crew personnel could return to man closures at Register Rock and Clark's Point.…  The rock fall emanated from a cliff just below a steep-slope ledge and the 11 August 1999 source area [ID 1999081101].  That rock fall had been larger and had damaged the two switchbacks of the horse trail at Valley View severely.  This latest rock fall was much smaller, capable of rapid cleanup with little rebuilding.  Kim Orr's trail crew cleared the trail on Thursday, 27 September, so it could be reopened after two days of observation of the source for safety.  The rock that hit the trail was smaller than the earlier rock fall, one to two cubic foot pieces with just a few slightly larger blocks.  About 300 feet of trail was littered with rock, but only about eight feet of outside wall needed work.…  As it turned out, this rock fall had included several sources, not all clearly visible.  … The latest source was about 950 feet above the trail switchbacks.  This source was roughly 16% the size of the 1999 source and included between 6 and 9 cubic yards of rock weighing 14 to 21 tons.  Like the 1999 event, this rock fall fell part way, then shattered on the cliff face which acted to spray broken rock widely over the trail.  The 1999 event removed many protective live oaks and maples, leaving the path more open for the latest rock fall.  Examining the source with the Questar from several different angles over a couple days gradually produced information on how this rock fall happened.  A pine tree had rooted and grown in the space between two clearly defined vertical slabs above a weathered horizontal joint.  Judging from large and small roots in the new sources, the pine tree had penetrated these slabs and had extended its roots in all directions for nutrient.  Toward the thinner outer edges of the largest slab there were old cracks, some of them along joint planes.  The roots were having greatest effects in these areas.  The source area is shown in an appended illustration.  The trigger for this rock fall was the storm of 25 September; however, that does not explain how the rock fall happened.  The source pattern with the sudden rain may offer an explanation, which would go something like this: After a long, very dry season, the first rain came with a rush.  Rainfall totals were only about 0.30 inches, perhaps closer to 0.50 inches in some locations during the thunderstorms, all in the space of three to four hours early in the morning.  Less than 50 feet above the source is a large sloping ledge covered with grass, holding a number of large blocks from the 1999 rock fall, and dipping sharply north and east.  Rainfall ran off the cliffs as well as off this steep ledge which acted as a small catchment basin.  Could the sudden filling of closed joints behind the remaining slabs at this source have exerted enough pressure pushing out that the thin, root-penetrated edges of the slab buckled and fell?  Such an explanation can account for both the timing and the pattern of sources around the tree, but such an explanation can only be tentative."""

The storm initiated at least two rock falls heard about 04:30, one from the Panorama Cliff above the Nevada Falls Horse Trail and another from the new source over the Ledge Trail above Curry Village. … Campers, Yosemite Institute groups at Curry Village, and employees all heard the rock fall.  Because the rock fall occurred at 04:30, no one could see where it came from, though it was clear nothing reached Curry Village itself...  The third failed slab, hanging below a prominent weathered diagonal joint, was probably weakened by the 14 September source [ID 2001091402] beneath it.  The 25 September  rock fall was obviously triggered by the sudden rainstorm after a very dry season.  The third failure was not as large in area as the second, but the third consisted of a much thicker slab producing larger blocks in the rock fall than either of the previous two events.  The third slab seems to have been up to six feet thick.  Only a crude estimate of size is possible.  The third failure looks about two and a half times the size in area of the 15 August source (ID 2001081501) but the third failure was a much thicker slab.  It was probably in the vicinity of 125 cubic yards or just about 300 tons.  Some splinters remained from the breaking away of this third rock fall, especially on the west edge of the source.  The new roof along the large diagonal joint is clean.  It is not possible to tell when or in which direction this source might progress.  There is no indication of widened or new cracks or joints in the massive cliff surface west of the Ledge Trail sources.  That cliff appears stable for the foreseeable future, but as these three rock falls have shown us, that can change overnight or within the flash of a lightning bolt.  It appears that the same diagonal joint pattern controlling the roof of the Curry Village rock fall is also a contributing factor in the roof of the Ledge Trail rock fall.  In the three Ledge Trail rock falls, failures have worked up to that defining joint but not beyond it.  Meanwhile, smaller diagonal joints dipping west and a vertical joint set seem to have defined much of the first two rock falls.  Those initial rock falls removed the underpinnings of remaining material which was both thicker and more weathered behind.  This third rock fall, though the largest, sent material downslope only as far as the 15 August event had.  Some rock jumped the gully wall and proceeded east toward the Foster Curry cabin talus, reaching about 50 feet further than the 15 August rock fall had.  In the main gully, several blocks made it as far as those furthest downslope in the 15 August event.  No rock from 25 September went beyond the gully to the west as 14 September rock had.  Distributions of rock from the three rock falls are shown on an accompanying topographic map section.  The 25 September event produced the largest sized rock of the three rock falls.  The lowest blocks from this rock fall were at least two times the size of those from the earlier events.  The size and distance of these three rock falls do not match the usual patterns.  The second largest rock fall (14 September) traveled farthest, while the largest reached only as far as the first or smallest rock fall from the Ledge Trail source area.  One distinctive difference between the pattern of fall from the Ledge Trail sources and the pattern of other rock falls is that the Ledge Trail sources do not follow a more or less direct path.  The Ledge Trail sources we know of have always been directed by the broad ledge and the gully and weathered joints draining it.  How open or blocked the paths along this ledge may be can easily affect the progress of rock fall...  But the greatest impacts to the gully occurred on 25 September, when larger rocks had larger impacts and moved some of those accumulated at junctions and turns farther downslope, loosening and rearranging the gully walls in the process.  One large boulder of about 10 tons at the gully turn was loosened and moved about 10 feet 14 September.  On 25 September, however, that boulder was hammered and sent down the gully nearly 200 feet further, stopping just above the farthest extent of the 15 August and 25 September rock falls."""

Across the valley residents thought that Indian Canyon was coming down.  Some staying at Curry Village worried that the rock fall was above them; a few left the park.  The rock fall fell with a loud noise followed by a rumble, according to one Curry Village guest, but it did not last long.  There was no evidence of anything reaching Curry Village, so there were no evacuations or closures.  There had been a storm that Monday which started warm in the afternoon but quickly dropped in temperature to leave snow on the valley floor by about 18:00 on 12 November.  The bulk of the storm was over by 22:00 when temperatures and snowlines began to rise.  Yosemite Valley received a total of 1.47 inches [3.73 cm] of precipitation in a fifteen hour period, but the greatest amount of precipitation was 0.97 inches [2.46 cm] between 3 and 6 pm, 12 November.  The cliffs were wet with running water through many joints the next day.  The Curry Village and Ledge Trail source areas were mostly wet and showing some internal seepage.  Because visibility was obscured by early mist, I could not check the Curry and Ledge Trail sources with the Questar until late morning, 13 November.  No changes were apparent in either source.  Scanning the cliffs for a new rock fall, a new source quickly turned up west of the Ledge Trail, Curry Village, and Staircase Falls.  The source was from about 5,000 feet elevation, probably just under the line of maximum extent of the Tioga glaciation at that point on the cliff.  A thin slab roughly 30 feet long, 12 feet high on the east side and roughly 6 feet high on the west, up to about 2 feet thick but often quite thin, had failed.  The failed slab appears to have been between 10 and 15 cubic yards in volume and between 24 and 35 tons in weight.  The failed slab appear to have been two thin vertical slabs partly weathered through at its east end.  The failed slab had no attachments behind.  Its major attachment was on the shorter west vertical break, though some fresh rock indicated there were a few remaining attachments along the east vertical break.  The source was easily spotted because it was one of the dirtiest I've seen.  Mud and dirt covered the source except for the vertical break on the west side.  A line of live oaks had grown from a horizontal joint delineating the top of the failure down into the vertical joint behind the slab.  A few of these small trees had fallen with the rock fall; at least one small tree was hanging upside down in the source.  Mud and dirt covered the cliff in a 200-foot-plus long wash below the source.  No doubt the next storms will wash most of this away.  The source lies immediately above a small roof, so the failure started with a short free-fall.  None of the source reached the valley floor, however, and none of it came dangerously close to Curry Village.  No ice was visible in any of these sources on 13 November or 19 November, although temperatures at the source have probably been around 32 degrees [Fahrenheit] several times recently this fall.  It seems clear that the 12 November storm triggered this source, but the appearance of the source may suggest more detail about the process of failure.  For one thing, the vertical joint behind the slab and parallel to the cliff face was completely weathered through.  There were no attachments at the back.  The eastern vertical break was clean, showing it had been the major support.  It appears, then, that the dirt behind the slab became heavily saturated with runoff from this storm.  The saturated earth exerted a pore-water pressure against the weak overlying slab, pushing it out just enough to break the minimal attachments on the east end and then the thin but last major attachment on the west.  The rock fall was followed down the cliff by a slurry of mud from behind the source."

The rock fall was very fresh and had come from further up the gully, where I recall there used to be some giant chockstones. . . .  we heard the sounds of rock fall from far above.  I stepped up to a vertical section right on the rap anchors and tried to make myself small under my little pack.  The rocks (1-2 feet in diameter?) missed me, but after a few seconds delay we heard a bigger rock and clearly deadly (3-10 feet in diameter?) cut loose.  Apparently it had been tipped over by the first rock fall, and now it thundered and crashed down the gully, bringing other large rocks down with it.  I yelled to Dennis that big rocks were coming down, “WATCH OUT!!!.”  I didn’t try to look at this one, but as it started slow, it seemed to be coming more down the center of the gully, and was not flying as randomly as the first one.

At 10:27 am, we were on the lower steps of the Mist Trail when we observed rock fall from the cliffs about 1.1 miles west and above Happy Isles.  There was a low, thunder-like crack, then dust and a long dribble of broken rock off a large, sloping ledge onto talus.  Two separate rock falls were reported to Park Dispatch.  Initially we could see only one source because dust obscured our visibility.  The second rock fall point was plainly visible the next day with a Questar telescope.  At 7:20 am on July 11, I [Snyder] examined the Happy Isles cliff and talus with the Questar telescope.  Two rock fall sources were clearly visible on the same cliff face about 50 to 75 feet apart.  Fresh abrasion marks, removed vegetation, freshly broken rock and old dark seepage lines all helped to determine the rock fall sources and paths from an elevation of about 5,400 feet.  By comparing the source area with the scale of nearby vegetation, I made crude estimates of the source areas and thickness of these rock falls.  The larger and higher source was triangular at its top, approximately 50 feet high and 50 feet across and approximately two feet thick at the top but tapering to nothing on its right side.  The bottom of the source was a long, thin plate about 50 feet high and 25 feet high and 25 feet wide but averaging only six inches in thickness.  This rock fall sourced approximately 164 tons (69 cubic yards) of material.  The smaller rock fall below and left of the larger also involved a thin sheet of an irregular shape with an approximate surface area 25 feet square.  This second failure looked thinner at the top than the larger failure, perhaps a maximum of 18 inches thick, and tapered to nothing along edges and bottom.  A rough estimate of the size of this source was about 41 tons (17 cubic yards).  Many other rock fall source scars are visible in the vicinity of these two sources.  An irregular scar on the left side of this source looks fresh at first but appears older on closer examination.  Along the lower edge of the triangle of the first source, … is a wide band of white rock.  Thin joints appear to exist between that band and the rock above and below it.  A joint also defines the right edge of the triangle.  Very light and slow but visible water seepage was observed on 11 July issuing from the points of intersection of these joints.  There was no visible seepage in the smaller source.  However, both sources showed dry, discolored (light brownish) drainage stains on the freshly exposed rock underneath the top edge of the sources.  There were no visible roots or vegetation remaining in the sources.  There was a freshly broken live oak bole and roots on the large, sloping ledge beneath the sources, but this tree probably came from impacts below the sources themselves.  Both rock falls fell vertically a short distance from their sources, landing and breaking up into smaller pieces of rock on a steeply inclined plane … That plane leads to a large buttress which has been heavily battered by previous rock fall from the top of the Happy Isles cliffs, including the 1996 rock fall (IDs 1996071101 and 1996071102).  This buttress caught much of the disaggregated rocky debris fragments of these current rock falls.  On 10 July 2002, for example, we watched the dust rise from the buttress much more than from the talus below.  The buttress also funnels most rock fall debris in the area to the top and right side of the talus cone beneath it.  The total distance from source to the terminus of deposit is approximately 3000 feet, horizontal map distance.  No facilities were affected by these rock falls.  There was no clearly distinguishable trigger for these rock falls.  There had been no rain since 31 May 2002.  Subsurface seepage observed from a number of cliffs had dropped off sharply in the month previous to these rock falls.  Peak snowmelt was early this year with several spring heat waves rapidly reducing the 95%-of-normal snowpack.  Freeze-thaw was therefore not a possibility for a trigger, and pore water pressure from infiltration of rain or snowmelt seems unlikely as well.  No significant earthquakes were felt or recorded on the day of the rock falls.  Absence of roots in the sources suggests vegetation also did not contribute to the failures.  The face of this part of the cliff where the rock falls sources, however, is distinctive in that it is an alcove cut slightly under the cliffs above and visibly oversteepened in both photographs and topographic maps.  The thin slabs free-fell from their sources.  The impacts several feet out from the cliff face were clearly visible with the Questar as was the small vegetation remaining unimpacted in the joint between the cliff face and the sloping ledge of impact.  The cliff face of the two rock fall sources is certainly at an angle of over 90 degrees at this point.  Unlike the cracking formation at the rock fall source over Curry Village, which rests on a cliff face of about 70 degrees, these new failures were quite literally hanging over open space.  The cliff face in this alcove may have avoided impacts during the third and fourth rock falls of the 10-11 July 1996 sequence because this face was recessed.  Formation of this alcove in conjunction with the orientation of joints on this cliff face set up the geometric configuration contributing to these failures.  The alcove serves as a conduit for surface and subsurface intermittent drainage from the small watershed above the 1996 Happy Isles source.  The alcove is just north of another drainage from the rim that produces an ephemeral waterfall in spring.  On the east-facing side of Glacier Point, there are many sets of joints that daylight with seepage and sometimes high quantities of flow, especially in the spring.  Many of these daylighting joints come from and below a very large ledge or bench which was the source of a huge prehistoric rock fall at Happy Isles….  Some of the weathering and long term geomorphic development of this recess has therefore been due to water-and ice-related processes of freeze-thaw and increased pore water pressures that initiate rock falls.  Perhaps more important is the fact that the new sources are at or not far below the line of maximum extent of the Tioga glaciers 20,000 years ago.  This rough line is determined by comparative weathering in cliff profiles along with the presence of vegetation in more weathered, receptive rock, among other things.  This oversteepened alcove may have begun as a product of glacial scouring and plucking in weaker rock, while stronger rock below it in the buttress and to the north in the long Glacier Point Apron resisted glacial erosion more successfully.  The alcove has been modified by later surface and subsurface runoff along with freeze-thaw; however, this cliff recess seems too large, too pronounced a feature to have been caused by small intermittent seeps and drainages alone."""

October 1, 2003):  ""The Half Dome rock falls came from the same source area on three occasions: 6 June, 19 June, and 29 June 2003.  On 6 June, several climbers were approaching the foot of Half Dome to begin a climb when blocks fell from the wall.  They were a hundred yards below the foot of the wall when one of them stumbled and broke an ankle.  None were hurt by the rock fall, but the individual with the broken ankle was carried out by National Park Service SAR.  The 19 June 2003 Half Dome rock fall was heard by visitors at Mirror Lake, who also saw the dust.  They did not see the source but their description placed it in the same vicinity as the events of 6 June and 29 June.  The 29 June Half Dome rock fall was the largest of the three.  Climbers observing it said a large plate sort of buckled and fell, passing over two climbers and pulverizing at the bottom.  National Park Service Helitack flew the rock fall to check for injuries.  Fire Guard Shawn Walters was on the flight and had also done some climbing in the area.  He said the failed flake was very thin, 18 inches to 2 feet thick, and that the source was dry at the time of the flight an hour after the failure.  The rock fall hit the sandy base immediately below Half Dome’s face, and was pretty well contained at the base of the cliff, although a couple of pieces they could see from the helicopter traveled a hundred yards downhill.  The failure took out the 5th pitch of a climb called “Kali Yuga,” shown in Don Reid, Big Walls (Evergreen, CO: Chockstone Press, 1993), pp. 151, 158.  Yosemite Valley ranger Dave Horne talked with climbers who had been on the Regular Northwest Face route not far away.  They saw two climbers near the Kali Yuga and heard creaking sounds about 6 am.  Knowing something was going to break, they called to the two climbers in warning.  When the failure occurred, the two climbers were in a cloud of dust and new talus.  They both survived and walked back to Camp Four covered with rock dust.  Though it does not seem possible to say exactly how these failures occurred, the character of the source hints at the progression.  A sketch of the source is attached.  It appears that the bottom plate fell out first on June 6.  There is a small source beyond a remaining triangular plate that may have produced the sounds heard June 19.  That small source may have been occasioned by the shifting of the plate above the June 6 failure.  That plate was defined partly by J2 joints and sat partly on a thin ledge formed by one of those joints.  That ledge, dipping east, probably acted to send the failing plate a little east and helped account for the observed buckling of the plate.  An estimate of size is difficult because of the great irregularity of the failures.  A crude estimate using the visible face of Half Dome as a measure of the scar can give relative figures of source size.  The face is about 2000 feet high at the point of the source, which makes the scar approximately 220 feet high by comparison, about 68 feet across on average, and 1.5 feet thick for the most part.  The three failures therefore totaled about 831 cubic yards and 1964 tons of rock.  The remaining triangular flake, which is freshly and clearly cracked all the way around, may be about 157 tons and 67 cubic yards in size.  The flake appears to be resting on a thin ledge formed by another joint system.  The flake also appears to have moved slightly west, probably pressuring the 29 June failed plate in the process or slipping a little as a result of that failure.  The cracks around this flake are as clear and threatening as those in the source above Curry Village.  Some of the cracks are also related to what appears to be the same J2 joint system on the Glacier Point cliffs.  There is no way to discern a trigger for this series of rock falls.  Staining in the new source shows that there had been seepage behind the failed flake long before it actually fell.  The stain comes much of the way down Half Dome’s face, running from Tissiack’s mouth to the source itself, usually on the surface, but sometimes along a subsurface J1 joint.  The stain was dry at the time of the failures.  There had been no storms to contribute to the failures. "

As she called the event in, visitors on the Nevada Falls Horse Trail also used cell phones to report an injured family at Valley View.  An incident command was set up with Valley District Ranger Steve Yu in charge of the SAR Cache.  Arrangements were made first for a medical examination of the victims, next for closure of the trail by signs and noncommissioned trail guards.  A rescue team was on site by about 13:30.  Mr. Guzman, 33, had been hit in the back of the head by a small rock, was in and out of consciousness, and had lost his sight.  He was carried down by wheeled litter.  Mrs. Guzman, 30, had a cut but no break on her leg.  Their infant suffered minor abrasions.  Mr. Guzman was flown to Modesto for surgery, and the others were sourced from the Yosemite Medical Clinic after evaluation and treatment.  The Nevada Falls Horse Trail was closed, manned, signed, and taped at Clarks Point and at the junction of the Horse Trail with the Mist Trail.  All foot traffic was routed by the Mist Trail.  Roe, Ludington, Larry Castro, and Snyder flew the source to assess safety and trail repair.  The source was dirty but nothing hanging.  The resulting plan was to leave the trail closed over the weekend and to let thunderstorms clean off the cliff face (which happened in an hour's downpour the next afternoon), assess the trail damage on Monday 21 July, and begin work Tuesday 22 July.  Trail guards assisted with the work closure, leaving the trail signed but unmanned during off-duty hours.  The trial was reopened Friday 25 July.  There had been no further rock fall from this source during the intervening period.  Joanna Cooke saw no blocks in the rock fall, only dust stretching down the cliff toward the westernmost switchback corner called Valley View.  What we saw shows the very great breakage suffered by the thin, weathered slabs as they hit the cliff below the source, free fell, then hit the cliff again, spraying over the trail switchbacks some 950 feet below the source.  As visiting climber Runar Hoiom's photograph shows, the first impacting buttress turned the rock fall a little east, just up trail from Valley View.  In this, the rock fall followed the pattern of its predecessors on 11 August 1999 [ID 1999081101, and 25 September 2001 [ID 2001092501].  The impact zone was roughly identical to the earlier rock falls.  Impacts to the trail had been greatest on 11 August 1999.  In this latest rock fall, the trail was covered with rock, soil, and a few trees with relatively little impact to the structure itself.  A photograph taken during the assessment flight shows the 17 July 2003, source and its surrounding area.  The source area appears to have been near or a little below the maximum extent of the Tioga glaciation 20,000 years ago.  Thinner sheets formed by the joint system parallel to the cliff face at this point may account for the greater weathering of this source area than might ordinarily be expected beneath the glacial line.  This source may also have been affected by rock from the 11 August 1999, rock fall which swept over the cliff edge at this point.  One large white block remains near the lip to show the trajectory of that rock fall.  The latest source was an extension of the storm generated 25 September 2001, Panorama Cliffs rock fall, although there was no storm or other clear trigger on 17 July 2003.  The source area showed plenty of subtle activity, however.  The source was a thin plate defined at the bottom by a major joint system, the same as the J2 system on the wall below Glacier Point and the same as the J2 system on Half Dome's face and showing in the June 2003, rock falls there [IDs  2003060601 -2003062901].  The J2 joint at the bottom of the source defined the bottom edge of the flake but provided little support for it.  The failed section was actually two thin flakes, through both of which a small pine had sent its roots.  Root clumps and dirt lay behind the failed flake along with some bigger roots from the pine.  The source was not clean and bright but showed the distinct colors of weathering.  Though the source was dry at the time of the failure, there is clear evidence of past seepage through it.  A large sharply sloping ledge above the source is formed also by the J2 joint system.  This ledge probably directs water toward the new source.  A sketch of the source area and remaining flake [shows] subsurface seepage and surrounding blocks, nearly all related to the steep inclined planes of the J2 joint system.  The large white block above the source remains from the 11 August 1999, rock fall and shows how much of that rock fall went over the cliff, possibly impacting the present source area.  The photo also shows the J1 joint system - the system of joints parallel with the cliff face - and vegetation growing on it.  Drainage down the inclined plane formed by J2 joints above feeds these vertical J1 joints a prominent source of subsurface seepage in the present source.  The sizes of the three rock falls are not easy to calculate because of the great variation in slab thicknesses.  …The triangular slab remaining above the roof is approximately 7-10 cubic yards or 17-24 tons.  This remaining slab appears attached at the sides but obviously has seepage flow occasionally behind it which continues to weather remaining connections.  The slab will fail, though failure is more likely to be in years rather than months.  Impacts will be comparable to the last two failures.  The fact is that the slab is weathered and thin will mean much dust and great clatter when it fails.  It will break up very much on its way down and will be sprayed over the trail by intervening buttresses on the cliff face.""     (2)  According to Jack Hoeflich, Valley District, reported by Inside National Park Service, Information Gateway for National Park Service Employees (written commun 23 July 2003):  ""Rock Fall Injures Family of Three Around noon on Thursday, July 17th, a ranger at Glacier Point reported by radio that a large rock slide and dust plume could be seen near Panorama Cliff.

On-duty rangers responded immediately from Yosemite Valley and Little Yosemite Valley.  A multiple casualty team made up of search and rescue team members, rangers from both the Valley District and Tuolumne Subdistrict, and trail and forestry crew members responded to the scene.  Injured hikers were about two miles up the trail.  The initial responders found Rudy and Gwendolyn Guzman and their 21-month-old daughter in the rubble.  About 250 feet of trail was covered with rocks up to four feet in diameter.  Rudy Guzman reportedly had been struck in the back of the head by a basketball-sized rock.  He was conscious, but extremely disoriented, and he could not see.  Gwendolyn Guzman and the baby had received minor back and leg injuries.  Rudy was placed in a vacuum body splint and transported down the trail in a wheeled litter.  Gwendolyn and her daughter were transported together in another wheeled litter.  The patients were met at the trailhead by ambulances.  Rudy was transported to the Ahwahnee Meadow, and then flown by helicopter ambulance to Doctors Medical Center in Modesto.

The 21 July 2003 failure may have been a delayed result of that heavy storm.  More rain occurred the next day, 22 July 2003.  Yosemite Research Library negatives 298 and 2809 taken by Ralph H. Anderson on 30 June 1938, and 10 July 1942, respectively, show the cliff face before the failure.  Those pictures show a bulging flake, quite thick on top tapering sharply toward its bottom.  Anderson’s photos also show live oak trees and bushes growing along the top of the flake.  Comparison of the flake edges with those trees and bushes led to a size estimate.  The top ridge of the flake varies from 10-12 feet thick to 15 feet thick.  The source is about 30 feet high and close to 40 feet across.  The total amount that fell in the series of failures from that source was, then, about 893 tons or 378 cubic yards of rock.  The rock slipped out, hit a ledge below the source, then free fell about 400 feet to a bench covered with talus, which was in turn covered with a patchy forest of live oak and pine.  Anderson’s photos show that there had been rock falls at this location before, and that the forest had been for some time growing back into an area opened by much earlier rock fall.  The July rock falls cleared out that forest, leaving fresh talus.  Much of the rock stopped on that talus-covered bench, but some went on down the next ledge to stop behind another growth of tall pines and mature live oaks.  As rock passed over the lip of the first ledge, it took off another weathered flake of about 26 tons and 11 cubic yards.  Altogether then, this series of four rock falls produced about 919 tons or 389 cubic yards of material."""

Allen Kunz, who lives in the Indian Creek apartments provided the best location somewhere near the Ledge Trail, while others swore it was nowhere near LeConte Gully.  Many thought it was from the Curry Village source.  A thorough examination of the cliffs on 21 July eliminated the Curry Village source as a source, for there had been no change there in the previous week.  Examination of the cliffs from LeConte Gully around the Glacier Point Apron isolated only one new source, and that was at the bottom of a series of three sources from August and September 2001.  The failed plate was thin, roughly rectangular, and fell from the lower east corner of the earlier source scar.

Visitors and Restoration employees alike saw a small rock fall from the top of the 22 February 2000, Middle Brother source.  Chelsea Kashner on the Restoration crew saw dust almost to the top and pretty much along a straight line down the cliff.  Abrasion marks were sparing on the bottom of the cliff.  The top of the 22 February 2000 source is a kind of weathered granitic rock in a forest of mature live oak.  The weathered rock does not look like the talus field one might expect on a high bench, the bench below the Mt. Broderick source for example.  Instead, it looks like very weathered blocks in a kind of cement, as if it may have been left there long ago by glacial action.  Regardless of its source, the live oaks have penetrated the conglomerate with their roots, producing many cracks of 1-2 inches.  This area has been the source of rock fall off and on since 2000.  Merrie Braun in a Camp 4 SAR site has recorded many small events from the Middle Brother cliffs since.  Many of these have probably emanated from the top of the 22 February 2000 source.  There was a short but torrential thunderstorm the afternoon of 18 July 2003.  This small rock fall may have been a delayed response to that storm, but no trigger can be assigned to the failure.  There have been small rock falls from the area since, but they have been smaller and break up, leaving much dust without reaching the road.  The 22 July event did not reach the road either but the fact that it was observed midday by many visitors made it an event of note.  It is not possible to come up with a size of the failure because the conglomerate source does not lend itself to clear-cut, visible source scars.  However, I would estimate that the failure was easily less than 50 tons.  A photograph shows the source and fall line of the rock fall."""

The rock bent the tower, knocking its legs out but also lodging against the bent and broken legs.  The transmission lines and the rock kept the tower precariously upright.  The bent tower was first noticed 18 December by Trail Worker Barry Hance, Jr.,  on his way to El Portal.  This block appears to have been loose, sitting on a steeply inclined slope of loose rock and soil, made up of material from a series of rock falls from the cliffs above.  The block was below a protruding, bluff-like formation composed of weathered blocks from earlier rock fall.  The source is at about 3000 ft. elevation or a little lower, roughly 300 feet above the tower and 450 feet above the El Portal Road.  The rock took great leaps down the mountainside, leaving impacts every 100 feet or so and finally coming to rest against the smashed tower.  Because its impacts were mostly in well-soiled areas covered with brush, live oaks, and grass, there was little secondary movement but also little breakage.  It appears the rock reached the transmission line virtually alone.  Periods of heavy rain in early December, along with freezing temperatures, suggest this rock slide was triggered by precipitation, but we cannot be certain.""

One rock about 30 inches in diameter had done the damage and come to rest in the center area of the tower's four legs.  This rock, however, was not alone.  Instead it was part of a group of often weathered boulders and also freshly broken rock which had come down an older debris-flow path just a few yards west of the tower.  The tower sits on a small bench formed by larger previous rock slides, and that bench restrained a portion of this failure.  Other, larger rocks passed the tower and stopped in the talus within about 50 feet of the El Portal Road.  Jose Lopez and Jim Snyder examined this rock slide area on 15 January 2004, but we were unable to see the source area from the ground.  After a flight on 28 January 2004, we could see the source area and path clearly.  We could see that the rock fall came down a traditional, intermittent drainage and that it had brought a quantity of weathered, partly rounded rock with it.  We estimated the source to be about 50 feet high by 8 feet across and 8 feet deep, a kind of long triangular piece, wedged into the cliff and sitting upright on a steeply outsloping shelf, and loosened partly by the root systems of one or two mature bull pines.  The piece that fell consisted of about 59 cubic yards weighing about 140 tons.  The block fell from about 3,400 feet elevation, breaking up on the cliff as it dropped.  It then entered the intermittent drainage which had been subject to several debris flows which had cleared out the live oaks and shrubs in their paths.  The upper part of the flow channel is ditched, while the lower part has the distinctive raised lobe of a debris flow that came to a stop on the slight bench near the transmission tower.  Impacts in this debris flow channel liberated the more weathered, rounded rocks that joined the initial fall on the way down.  The latest debris flow lobe, ending near the tower, seems composed of soil and roughly 1.5 feet of rocks for the most part.  The lobe acted as a cushion for some rocks in this event but also may have deflected several rocks toward the tower, contributing to the damaged uphill leg.  Major December storms occurred 5-7 December, 10-11 December, 13-15 December, 20-21 December, 24-26 December, and 29 December 2003 -3 January 2004.  Because this rock fall occurred in a traditional drainage subject also to debris flows, the likelihood that the event was triggered by precipitation is great but cannot be stated for sure.""

There was no clear attachment to the cliff, but the failed block had cleared a path through live oak and pines from the source at about 3,800 feet just west of Cascade Creek as it enters the small valley of Cascades and joins the Merced River along the El Portal Road.  The block broke up as it slide and fell down several narrow benches into wooded talus, coming to rest above approximately 3500 feet.  (The El Portal Road in the area is at about 3,440 feet.)  The rock slide is clearly visible from the Cascades bridge.  Robert Cameron, Above Yosemite (1983, p. 9) has an aerial photograph of the Cascades area showing this cliff.  The block that failed is distinctive, appearing to be completely detached from the wall, a thick slab that simply laid over at some point before 1983 without going down the cliff.  The source in Cameron's photograph is bright white and unweathered by comparison with many other sources on the cliff.  This block appears to be very approximately 20 x 15 x 5 feet  overall or about 56 cubic yards.  This crude estimate suggests the block was >50 cubic yards in any case.  Grass around the failure and newly broken vegetation shows the Cascades rock fall had no recent impact at the source but was indeed a detached block.  It slid on soil, vegetation, and smaller rock before breaking up and crashing into the talus.  The vegetation was quite green and fresh when we saw it.  The situation of failure appears to have been one of ground saturation.  Perhaps earlier storms and gradual erosion over the years had removed enough soil underpinnings to create a new instability.  The trigger was probably one of the December-January storms when heavy rains and snow saturated the ground underneath the detached block enough that more rain could move it.  Those storms before Jose Lopez's observation occurred 5-7 December, 10-11 December, 13-15 December, 20-21 December, 24-26 December, and 29 December 2003 - 3 January 2004.

The reporting visitor and another pair of visitors were able to continue on the trail by scrambling over the boulders and trees.

It was undetermined when the rock fall occurred.  At about 11:00 Park roads and trails foreman Tim Ludington surveyed the area from a helicopter which prompted a temporary trail closure while further assessments of the rock fall area could be made.  On 8 January 2004 trail crew foreman Dave Kari and Johnny Ray hiked up to the slide area which is slightly west of Columbia Point.  They discovered two large 'desk-sized' boulders in the trail and a leaning oak over the trail.  Kari reported that dangerous conditions still exist as snow build-up (now hardened, but melting) is acting as a temporary stabilizer, preventing further slide debris from tumbling.  Kari reports that as the snow melts, unstable rock debris might source.  Kari and Ray removed the leaning oak.""     (3) According to Jim Snyder (written commun., 21 January 2004):  ""It is not possible to determine exactly when this rock fall occurred.  Given the frequency of use of the Yosemite Falls Trail even in winter, however, we can narrow the time of occurrence with some certainty to 20-23 December. If it occurred before the December 20, a period of good weather, a report would have likely come in about it.  A storm on 20-21 December 2003 probably prevented almost all trail use.  The earthquake of 22 December 2003 may also have prevented use, so a report of damage on 24 December would be a fairly quick response given the weather and time of year.  Jose Lopez and Jim Snyder examined the source from the trail, from the air, and with a Questar telescope.  The source is at an elevation of about 5,300 feet.  The failed slab was about 80 feet long, 15 feet wide, and 4-5 feet thick, or about 222 cubic yards, and 525 tons.  At or near the top of the slab grew one large yellow pine, and maybe a second pine, which had extended its roots roughly a third of the way down behind the slab.  Much of the plane behind the failed slab was weathered.  When the slab failed, it threw the large yellow pine to a wooded ledge just west of the source.  The slab slid from its source, fell a ways down the cliff, breaking up as it went, soon hitting the talus and live oak-pine forest.  Much of the rock stopped there, cutting a wide swath through the forest, but some material made it to the Yosemite Falls Trail at about 4680 feet, about 50 yards east of the first stream crossing at the top of the lower 48 switchbacks of the trail.  A few rocks went even further, one apparently damaging a corner of those lower switchbacks.  Snow soon covered the debris.  Some loose rock remained visible on ledges above the trail, so the trail was closed for further observation and eventual repair."""

(2) According to Jim Snyder (written commun., 21 January 2004):  ""Media Relations Chief Scott Gediman was the reporting party for this event and explained to Jim Snyder on 21 January 2004 what he experienced.  Gediman was walking out of the Administration Building when he heard a loud, rumbling sound from the direction of Sentinel Rock.  He told Jim Snyder that it was quite loud and that he could hear the impacts of individual rocks clearly within it.  He saw no dust and could not see the location.  Scott went back into the building, but others had not heard it.  He called Valley District Ranger Jim Tucker and Park Dispatch to report the event.  No one saw or heard any other, later failures from that area.  I [Snyder] looked for new sources in the Sentinel Rock and Sentinel Creek area, but found none from exposed cliff faces.  This failure seems to have been a debris slide from an unconsolidated till or debris at about 6,000-6,200 feet elevation just west of Sentinel Creek.  The volume of this debris slide cannot be easily estimated, but 200 cubic meters would be reasonable considering earlier failures in the same area [ID 1980052704 and 1983052001] and Gediman's description of the sound.  Snow covers the source area, preventing a better estimate.  This failure affected no facilities, but we did notice that the failure and others like it have contributed to a channel change in the Sentinel Creek gorge below Sentinel Falls.  There has been a huge bank failure there, sending many, many tons of material into the creek and down toward Southside Drive.  Most of the larger material in the 1997 flood and later has stopped at the mouth of the small but impressive Sentinel Creek gorge, leaving only a very small barrier to prevent the creek from changing direction from its more recent historic crossing of Southside Drive east of the turnoff to Sentinel Beach to a more direct route flowing across a broad fan west of that turnoff and west of the picnic area.  This rock fall was an indication of how Sentinel Creek has frequently altered its lower channel.  This failure may well have had an earthquake trigger.  Though there was 0.33 inches [0.84 cm] of rain on 20 December and 0.29 inches [0.74 cm] on 21 December, no rain fell on 22 December.  The failure could have been triggered by precipitation saturation, however, in conjunction with an earthquake.  In Yosemite Valley, there were reports of goods shaking on shelves in Degnans and the Village Store.""

Subsequently, 68 guest units were evacuated and a closure perimeter was established around the rock fall zone.  Emergency personnel worked through the night and into the following day searching for injured visitors and assessing damage to park infrastructure. …""     (3) According to Jim Snyder (written commun., 8 January 2004):  ""This rock fall occurred at night [00:45] during a heavy snowstorm.   A number of duplex cabins-with-bath were hit at the west end of Curry Village.  About 100 people were evacuated to accommodations in El Portal.  Twenty-one duplex cabins were closed first, but when day broke and it was easier to see large flyrock, thirteen more duplex cabins were included within the closure.  A foot of snow on the ground made it impossible to determine the flyrock and talus patterns clearly at impact.  Some small rock had clearly gone beyond the closure area.  Damage to the cabins occurred in two ways.  One kind of damage occurred when pieces of the rock fall hit large rocks in the Curry vicinity and exploded on impact, sending smaller pieces through the cabin sides and windows.  These pieces tended to be smaller, though it was just by good fortune none of them were lethal.  The second kind of damage came from rocks launched high in the air and coming through the roofs, eaves, and porches, sometimes through north-facing roof pitches.  These rocks, generally the size of a sink or half a woodstove, seem to have been launched at a high velocity from the J2 joints forming the east-trending ledges of Staircase Falls.  These ledges slope outward as well as downward and can easily throw higher velocity rock toward Curry Village's west end.  The source is visible from the cabins.  It is located on the northeast side of a small fin separating LeConte Gully from the big ledge of the old Ledge Trail and Staircase Falls at about 5800 feet elevation.  The source extends to the top of this fin, so there is nothing unstable above it.  The source is about 2000 feet southwest of the west end of Curry Village.  It was the J2 east-trending joints that funneled the rock fall so far east to the Curry duplexes.  Ordinarily these joints protect Curry because they funnel most rock fall down the big ledge into the talus behind the Nob Hill Showerhouse.  [Guzzetti et al. (2003) show a model of the topographic effects of the ledge on rock fall from above Staircase Falls]  Even in this rock fall, part of the material remained on that big ledge.  But the source was far enough west, with enough of an initial drop that a large portion of the material took the path of Staircase Falls.  SAR photo #5456, taken in the 1970's, shows a partly overgrown track through the live oaks from the source to the top of the Staircase Falls.  Since the duplexes were built 1918-1922, this track suggests that rock fall from the same location occurred about 100 years ago.  Smaller rock fall from the source may have fallen in the interim, however, without reaching Curry Village or being reported.  The first thing Chief Ranger Steve Shackelton noted about the source was its unusual color, not steel gray but fawn or rusty.  That was a sign of weathering at the source area.  SAR photo #5456 and Dan Horner's spring 2001 photograph of the cliff clearly show a long weathered roof with a small tree growing at its top.  Examination with the Questar suggested that there had been three layers of this roof stacked one on top of the other, with roots and seepage going behind and through them.  West of the roof were two other thinner plates which were apparently launched as the roof failed.  Several estimates have suggested a jumble of irregularly shaped blocks about 20 feet high and 60 feet across with thicknesses up to 6 feet.  Tapering of the formation at the top and a thinner plate on the west side indicate that 267 cubic yards or 630 tons might be close to a maximum accounting for what actually fell.  All the blocks and plates but one were weathered, with very few signs of fresh breakage along unweathered surfaces.  The one block that showed an entirely unweathered break was a small plate roughly 3.5 feet thick underneath the others.  Seepage had been pouring through the weathered roof at the time of the failure, for after the storm there was a small ice waterfall present next to the unweathered break.  These observations suggest that the greater weight on top of a thinner though less weathered plate contributed to the initial failure of that plate during the storm.  The plate was a keyblock supporting the rest, so the two layers above it fell and dragged the two weathered western plates with them.  The remaining source is composed of weathered blocks often separated by wide, weathered joints along several different joint planes.  The source sits at the top of a fin between LeConte Gully and Staircase Falls.  J2 joints, among others, pass from the source formation into LeConte Gully.  Seepage and flows from that gully along J2 and other joints contributed to the weathering of the formation over the last million years, since the source is above the maximum level of the Tioga glaciation.  Flows from LeConte Gully through the formation have left a markedly dark stain on the cliff and have been the source of a small, intermittent drainage which makes its way to the cliff at the head of Staircase Falls.  The weathering of this fin is more substantial than on the massive face of Glacier Point because the fin is much thinner and exposed on two sides as well as being subject to the heavier joint seepage from LeConte Gully.  Much of the failed rock came down Staircase Falls, but a large percentage remained on the big ledge.  Later rock fall, such as ID #2003122603, came not from the source but from debris remaining on the big ledge.  Drainage through the source from LeConte Gully was slowly washing through the debris and snow, with muddy issue from the snow appearing between storms.  Smaller rocks have been moving with the storms toward the cliff's edge.  The duplexes will probably remain closed until unstable material is washed away, leaving more stable material behind.  This rock fall also happened in the midst of a storm. A check of the weather records for Yosemite Valley - station YSV in the California Data Exchange Center website- shows that 0.52 inches [1.3 cm] of precipitation fell on 24 December, 0.84 inches [2.1 cm] on 25 December and 2.76 inches [7.0 cm] on 26 December 2003.  There was some freezing with this because snow was falling heavily  on the valley floor.""     (4) According to Jim Snyder (written commun., 28 December 2003):   ""Some smaller rocks (football size?) went horizontally through a cabin or two.  One of these broke through a window, went right over the head of a sleeping person, and crashed into a mirror in the bathroom.  Another pingpong ball size rock went through a window in the residence behind the Nob Hill showerhouse - this seems to be the farthest east impact, and nobody could quite figure out where that rock came from.  Behind cabin 80 there were a number (20-30) of trees 12-14 inch diameter snapped off by rock.  Some rocks came down vertically into the cabins, crashing through the roof and between beds with sleeping people.  Four people were treated for minor scrapes and scratches.  Nobody had to go to the hospital.  Evacuees were taken to Parkline just outside the park on Highway 140 for the night.  Monitors listened for rock fall for about 12 hours and heard nothing more.  There were no rock falls from the 1998-99 Curry source during this storm.

Numerous boulders as large as 11 m3 fell to the lower limit of the talus slope at the base of Staircase Falls.  Several flyrock fragments extended as much as 75 m beyond the base of the talus.  Observation of the detachment area in April 2004 revealed an estimated volume of 350 m3 of potentially unstable rock remained in the form of a fractured, jointed, and moderately weathered bedrock fin.  Some rock debris remained perched on the ledges below the detachment area, and the cumulative volume of debris now present is approximately 840 m3, presenting an additional hazard."""

The source appeared as a rectangle of clean, fresh granite on a lichen covered wall next to an intermittent drainage.  The rather thin rectangular flake hung nearly vertically about 40 feet east of an intermittent drainage often frozen in winter at an elevation of about 6,500 feet.  The flake was approximately 20 x 15 x 4 feet or about 44 cubic yards (105 tons).  Though the source appeared clean, there was dirt and mud on the outsloping ledge beneath it, suggesting there had been some soil and vegetation there which was dislodged by the source.  The flake failed, probably broke up some, slid over a short outsloping ledge, then had a 1,500 foot freefall into a talus-loaded, loose, saturated, steep gully beginning at about 5,000 feet.  Impacts from the flake fragments dislodged rocks in this gully.  A few small rocks landed on the trail at 4,680 feet.  One larger one may have contributed to damage on the corner of a lower switchback in the talus below.  This day brought 2.76 inches  [7.01 cm] of rain and snow to Yosemite Valley, preceded by 0.52 inches [1.32 cm] on 24 December and 0.84 inches [2.13 cm] on 25 December 2003.

Lopez further reported that about 50 feet of trail had been covered and damaged by the rock fall.  Lopez confirmed no one appeared to be injured.  It is unknown when the actual rock fall occurred.  I enacted a temporary trail closure at the Happy Isles trailhead and search and rescue technician Gab Flaxman hiked up to the Vernal Falls footbridge where he set up barricades and signs, closing the upper section above the rock fall.  The area remains closed with barricades, tape and signs while further investigation of rock fall danger, trail assessments and repair are complete.""     (2) According to Jim Snyder (written commun. 4 February 2004):  ""This rock fall occurred about 75 yards above the spring on the John Muir Trail southeast about 900 feet from the Happy Isles Nature Center.  The source is about 75 feet in elevation above the trail at an elevation of about 4,200 feet.  The source is about 50 feet wide and 30 feet high but with a varying thickness.  The slide was initiated when several large blocks broke out of a pocket at the bottom of the source.  This pocket of larger material was about 38 feet long, 12 feet high, and 6 feet deep at the top; however, the rocks in it were thinnest at the bottom, clumsy triangles resting on a thin, outsloping lip on a joint plane dipping 42 degrees to the northwest.  Since the rocks fell just across the trail with little breakage, a possible progression of the slide could be determined.  A block at the northeast end of the pocket seems to have failed first, followed by three other large blocks just southwest.  The overburden was quite weathered, fractured, and finely penetrated by live oak roots.  Removal of the bottom blocks brought failure of the top and some rock along the sides, probably up to 30 inches thick.  A rough estimate of the total volume is 165 cubic yards or 388 tons.  The rock slide swept away much of a small band of talus and trees bordering the trail.  The source was weathered with many roots.  There had been few fresh rock connections.  Though there were streams of seepage on both sides of the source, some of them developing ice cascades during the storms of the period, there was no evident seepage in any quantity in the source itself.  The soil of the roots, however, was damp, and the vegetation growing on the failed blocks showed this location to be a moist one.  Such a well-weathered source so far beneath (approximately 1,200 feet) the line of maximum extent of the Tioga glaciation is unusual, especially in this area where the ice was thickest. There had been no precipitation since 3 January, but there was still a lot of snow on the ground, with snowmelt during the day and freezing temperatures at night.  It is not possible to determine a trigger.  This source may have destabilized more material on its southwest end, for several older cracks showed signs of widening after the failure.  It was too wet and slippery to get on top of the source to see if there had been any crack widening there.  The source was otherwise clean and seemed no immediate threat to the trail or passing visitors.  Trail crews put a way trail through by 29 January, intending to wait until spring before fully repairing the trail.  The trail was posted at the rock fall area with a rock fall warning and description."""

At least one larger block and several smaller blocks and slabs fell from the base of a partial arch formation broken at the top by a cross-cutting joint forming a ledge with live oak brush.  It looked like a pile of partly free, mostly weathered rock with vegetation in it that collapsed and mobilized other debris, especially in the gully below.  The volume was very difficult to estimate, hence the general estimate of 20 m3.  There was a live oak tree trunk within the source area.  The dark color in back of it may have been moist soil from the rootball.  The tree trunk was on several thin slabs cracked into blocks, which may have toppled the rock formation forward.

The long flake [that failed] had been hit hard once, and perhaps twice, in 1996.  The white scar just left of the new source is from 1996, when the end of the flake was broken off by impacts above.  The source appears to be about 75 feet long, 25 feet high, and about 8 feet thick.  The failure was in the neighborhood of 556 cubic yards, or 1,313 tons.  A bright little girl of about 6 years old clearly saw the rock fall and told me emphatically that she saw small rocks fall first, then the big slab came down.  The source was very dirty with material perhaps washed in behind it both before and after [the rock falls of] 1996.  Earlier photos show no vegetation around the source, which is over 200 feet below the Tioga maximum.  The Tioga maximum is marked by the edge of the long, inclined plane below the 1996 source, the plan or ramp which launched the big blocks in that event to create airblasts on the Valley floor.  The failed block appears to have been broken along well weathered cracks at its top and along its north edge.  The only visible cracks were at the bottom, suggesting that the slab fragment was held in place by a relatively thin connection at the bottom.  This piece appears to have had two or three thin J1 joints through it, parallel to the face.  My guess is that, with pressure of the weathered slab above, following the 1996 impacts, this bottom connection began to break first on 13 July, producing the smaller rock the little girl saw and removing the last support from the larger part of the slab above.  The slope below the source is about 80 degrees...  Scrape marks are abundant to show how it fell straight down a ways and then free fell to the talus below, where it was largely pulverized on impact.  Vegetation that had grown back on the new talus slope formed in the 1996 event was removed in a small area.  The dust cloud was said to have risen a thousand feet or more, according to Sara Franklin, who was giving a tour on a Valley tram at the time.  The manager of the Happy Isles Nature Center felt the impact of the rock fall and saw the dust...  There is no clear trigger for the event.  The source is dry and the area around it is dry.

The debris flow seems to have consisted more of mud and small rock fragments than large rock fragments.  The exact source area on Rancheria Mountain could not be determined.  The flow came down the mountain and entered an area along Piute Creek thick with vegetation.  The flow tore through these smaller trees, abrading them heavily, uprooting some, and also moving large logs downstream, leaving piles of sand and small rock fragments in its wake.  It broke into at least two channels in the area of the thick, smaller trees.  The debris flows were ~5-6 feet in depth and a dozen or more feet across.  The channels varied frequently between deeper/narrower and wider/shallower.  The thinner material did not leave debris levees on either side but did spread out here and there in the thick vegetation. Upon entry into Piute Creek the flow gouged at the channel and banks, leaving tons of material in its downstream wake.  The debris flow seemed powerful enough even to have altered the course of Piute Creek a little by forcing the main stream more to the rocky east side of its channel. Had this debris flow occurred during the 22-25 July 2006 storm [which initiated several debris flows from the south wall of the canyon; see IDs 2006072201-2006072205], the trees would have already leafed out, but the trees killed by this debris flow had not even begun to bud.

Ludington reported a new deposit of sand, gravel, cobbles, and small boulders at the mouth of an unnamed channel on the south side of the Tuolumne River upstream of Pate Valley and headed approximately below Double Rock.     (2)  According to Jim Snyder (written commun., January 2011):  ""One and a half to two miles upstream from Pate Valley on the Tuolumne River at about Mile 132, there were at least four debris flows during the storm lasting from 22-25 July [see item (3)]. The largest debris flows came from the north-facing canyon walls above the river, beneath Double Rock  The walls on the north-facing side in this vicinity are higher than walls just north of the river, contributing more rock debris to the slopes there and capable of gathering more water in runoff and storms than the south-facing wall at Mile 132.  The south-facing wall is mostly exposed, glaciated bedrock running into the river with little talus accumulation.  The north-facing wall has much more talus accumulation by comparison and much more of the slope is forested. At the top of the vegetated talus there are numerous rock fall and debris channels coming out from the cliffs and penetrating the vegetated talus to varying degrees. Breaks in the vegetation near the top of the talus indicate constantly changing channel courses moving around previously deposited material. Only two of these seem to have reached the river prior to the 22-25 July 2006 storms.  Of the two debris flow channels that show on earlier aerials, the easternmost enters the river at about UTM 274190 E and 4200720 N.  I did not examine this channel on the ground.  It appears in the 1955 aerial to be open but partially overgrown in comparison with the 1997 aerial photograph.  Nevertheless, it regularly contributes debris to the river, enough that it has partially dammed the river to create a beautiful long pool below the trail, which must climb the exposed cliff above it to get around this part of the river.  The channel comes from far up the slope and appears ordinarily to be full of loose rock and debris.  It is quite possible that this channel also delivered a debris flow to the river in July 2006.""    (3)  Maps of lightning strikes from 22-25 July 2006 show numerous strikes in the vicinity of Double Rock on the afternoon of 22 July 2006, suggesting that an intense thunderstorm on that date likely triggered the debris flows in the Tuolumne River canyon."

The uppermost channel (Mile 132A) entered the river at roughly UTM 274500 E and 4200760 N, while the larger channel just west (Mile 132B) entered the river at roughly UTM 274400 E and 4200720 N.  These channels may have been controlled in part by huge rock fall blocks in the talus.  These channels emanate high on the cliff on steep bedrock slopes that hold some rock debris but that also can quickly accelerate rapid runoff.  A great deal of the rock debris blocks the water as it hits the lower angled talus, causing water and rock to seek places to go.  The constant moving of water and rock near the top of the talus has created a myriad of channels down the talus very similar to the vegetated talus of the Sentinel Creek fan or the Taft Toe fan in Yosemite Valley.  The channel of 132B seems to have been the larger and deeper of the two, carrying and depositing greater loads through both of the forks at its mouth.  The two openings of 132B also dammed the river enough to force it up on the Tuolumne Canyon trail.  In the case of the debris flows at Mile 132, the talus here is formed in part by rock fall debris but also in part by debris flows.  This combination of depositional origins is likely responsible for the lower angle of repose in this talus than in others for which rock fall seems the dominant source."""

The debris flow came out of apparently near-vertical joints behind and adjacent to a small dome about 5,600 feet in elevation.  This debris flow carried smaller and less material than its neighbors upstream.  The bedrock over which the trail passes made it possible for the debris flow to sweep more material into the river, though much was still held behind by small ledges or irregularities in the rock.

The rock fall consisted of a slab approximately 35 x 7 x 2-3 m (735 m3, assuming a 3 m thick slab).  After detaching along a sheeting joint from beneath a prominent curving arch, the slab slid down a steeply inclined surface for 60-80 m and then impacted a lower-angle section of the face where the rock began to break apart.  The rocks then fell into Bushido Gully and the central gully beneath the northwest face, producing a substantial dust cloud that was observed throughout eastern Yosemite Valley and Tenaya Canyon.  Several boulders fell down to the floor of Tenaya Canyon, and subsequent investigation revealed fresh boulders up to 1 m in diameter on the talus slope at the base of the central gully.  The rock fall substantially altered the lower pitches of the climbing route ""Promised Land"", which ascends along the western side of the failed slab.  This event was the largest in a series of rock falls that occurred over many days.  A climber witnessed the first rock fall in the series on 20 July 2006 and observed more events on 25 July 2006.  Climbers report hearing minor but steady rock falls for the next two days until the large source, and also observed another slab approximately 3 x 1 x 2 m fall the day following the large rock fall.  This account suggested the  rock falls occurred as a progressive failure of the large flake underneath the arch.  When the source area was observed from a helicopter approximately 75 minutes after the event, the area was dry, but dark water stains were present on the detachment surface, indicating at least seasonal flow of water through the sheeting joints that formed the back side of the failed slab.  The detachment surface showed staining over most of its surface area, with only freshly broken surfaces along the edges, suggesting the flake was detached over much of its ~35 m horizontal span and only pinned at the edges prior to failure.  Yosemite Valley experienced several days of thunderstorms prior to the event, with some precipitation at Half Dome; however, water flow is not specifically identified as a trigger because the rock-fall detachment surface was dry when observed approximately 45 minutes after the failure.  Stress redistribution and progressive destabilization resulting from earlier rock falls may have contributed to failure, but a specific triggering mechanism for this rock fall is not recognized.  However, the fact that the rock fall occurred near the end of a very hot summer day, when the northwest face receives full sun, suggests that thermal stress (expansion and contraction of the relatively thin flake) may have played a role in triggering the rock fall."

Fisherman Herb Dunn captured a sequence of impressive photographs of the rock fall and subsequent debris slide, which were posted on geology.com.  The rock fall was a clean detachment along a roughly surface parallel sheeting joint, with only subtle staining and weathering of the rock around the margins of the detachment surface, suggesting fresh cracking along most of the detachment surface.  The air temperature during the event was very warm (~90 degrees Fahrenheit), and Elephant Rock receives direct sunlight in the afternoon, suggesting that rock surface temperatures were considerably warmer.

Numerous large Douglas Firs were snapped or toppled by boulders moving down the talus slope below the Ledge Trail.  Rock debris traveled down the east side of the talus slope and into the southeastern part of Curry Village in the vicinity of the Foster Curry Cabin.  One unoccupied tent cabin just east of the Foster Curry Cabin was severely damaged by a 1 m3 boulder, and another was struck by a small flyrock (4 cm diameter) fragment.

(3)  According to Noreen Trombley, National Park Service (oral commun., November 2008):  A volunteer work crew supervised by National Park Service staff was working at Lower Pines campground on 7 October 2008 and reported hearing at least two sharp cracking sounds (described as sounding like gunfire) from the cliff below Glacier Point several hours prior to the rock fall.     (4)  According to a post by ""Lightgirl""on the Supertopo Forum (written commun., 8 October 2008):  ""I was working in Lower Pines yesterday [7 October 2008] morning when I thought I heard fire crackers.  I didn't see anyone with them, but it went on randomly for maybe twenty minutes or so.  The two rangers I was working with didn't recognize the sound either.  One or two sounded more like gun shots.  About an hour later I heard the first small rock fall.  Ten or so minutes later it sounded like a very small rock fall.  It wasn't until a couple hours later that that the big one started above the Ledge Trail.""  [Although the exact source of the cracking sounds cannot be confirmed, it is likely that these sounds emanated from the 7 October (and/or 8 October) 2008 rock-fall source area on Glacier Point, suggesting that crack propagation was occurring along the sheeting joint(s) that eventually became the detachment surfaces for the rock falls.] "

(2011)","(1)  According to Park Geologist Greg Stock:  A second, larger rock fall occurred from above the Ledge Trail at Glacier Point on 8 October 2008, from the same location as the rock fall of the previous day [see ID 2008100701].  As with the previous event, the failed rock mass detached from a steeply inclined northeast facing sheeting (exfoliation) joint surface parallel to the cliff face, and free fell approximately 220 m, impacting the east-dipping ledge of the Ledge Trail and fragmenting into numerous boulders and smaller debris.  Both the 7 and 8 October rock fall runout paths were strongly influenced by the Ledge Trail ledge, but unlike debris from the 7 October rock fall, which primarily impacted the far eastern side of the talus slope below this ledge, rock debris from the 8 October rock fall went primarily straight down this talus slope along the path of the seasonally active stream channel, fanning out as they moved down the slope but primarily impacting the central part of Curry Village south of the Pavilion and Amphitheater.  Large Douglas Firs and cedar trees were snapped and toppled by boulders as they bounced and rolled down the talus slope.  The largest boulder, which came to rest within the gully on the central part of the talus slope, upslope of tent cabins in the central part of Curry Village, was approximately 150 m3 in volume.  One boulder approximately 3 m in diameter rolled over three unoccupied tent cabins just east of here and came to rest essentially on a hard-sided cabin that had been vacated roughly 20 minutes earlier.  Several other hard-sided cabins in the immediate vicinity sustained damage from impacts of flyrock and larger particles (up to 80 cm), including punctured walls and broken windows.  Overall at least 25 tent and hard-sided cabins sustained some kind of impact, and 3 hard-sided cabins were totally destroyed.  Some of these cabins were occupied at the time of the rock fall but the occupants escaped major injury.  Three minor injuries were associated with the rock fall; one child received a cut on his forehead from a rock fragment, one woman was injured while fleeing the scene, and one person sustained an asthma attack as a result of the incident.  Several boulders also impacted the base of the talus slope farther to west, directly beneath Staircase Falls; photographs of the rock fall occurring, taken by National Park Service employee Brad Benter from the northwest face of Half Dome, show some rock debris taking a direct path over the ledges that create Staircase Falls, rather than being diverted eastward by the Ledge Trail ledge as most of the debris was.  The boulders that went straight over the ledge landed within 20 m of hard-sided cabins below Staircase Falls but did not cause any damage [these cabins were permanently closed in June 2008 due to rock fall hazards from the Staircase Falls area and were not occupied at the time of the 8 October rock fall].     (2)  From San Francisco Chronicle (2008):  ""A large slab of granite cracked loose from a cliff in Yosemite National Park early Wednesday and crashed into the Curry Village resort with a thunderous roar, flattening tents and forcing hundreds of cmapers to run for their lives.  Dozens of schoolchildren fled the scene screaming and crying as broken rock rained down, snapping trees, smashing through the walls of cabins and sending a plume of dust hundreds of feet in the air.  'It sounded enormous, like the earthquakes I've been in in Los Angeles' said Tom Voelpel, a lighting technician from Valencia who was sharing a tent at Curry Village with his twin brother, Dave, in celebration of their 50th birdthday.  'You could hear trees snapping and rock crunching and cracking against each other.'  The brothers jumped gehind the wooden wall of their cabin just as a boulder smashed through the wall, causing it to collapse on top of a nightstand.  'It was scary,' said Dave, an artist from Indianapolis who saw one bleeding boy amid the dozens of panic-stricken schoolchildren.  'I want to go home,' he said the boy screamed.  'I'm bleeding!'...  The place [Curry Village] erupted in pandemonium as hundreds of terrified campers rushed out in underwear and nightclothes amid a road that several witnesses said sounded like thunder.  Deanne Maschmeyer, 41, of Seaside (Monterey County) was sleeping next to her 14-year-old daughter and 12-year-old son when the slide began.  At first they crouched down.  Then her daughter, Alexis Mooneyham, screamed 'Run for your lives!'  'We literally bolted out of bed and started running,' Maschmeyer said.  'It was like the tsunami footage several years ago.  We hurdled fences and sprinted through the meadow.  It was a pure adrenaline rush.  We were surrounded by kids crying and yelling.'  The three of them found themselves in the parking lot in skimpy clothes.  Maschmeyers son, Connor Mooneyham, was wearing only boxer shorts.  A Yosemite park worker gave him his coat.  Strangers and park workers gave them clothes to wear....  All occupants of the more than 600 tent and wooden cabins and a small, hotel-style building at Curry Village were ordered out as a precaution, and trails in the area were closed, Yosemite officials said.  In all, 1,005 people were evacuated.  By nightfall, 100 to 150 had been allowed back in, but the rest were put up in motels and hotels surrounding the park, unable to retrieve their belongings...""     (3)  From Stock et al. (2011):  Repeat photography and laser scanning of the cliff before and after the rock falls revealed that the ""cumulative failure [7 and 8 October 2008 events] consisted of a near-planar, vertically-oriented rock slab with a maximum length of 69.0 m, a mean thickness of 2.1 m, a maximum thickness of 7.1 m a detachment surface area of 2750 m2, and a volume of 5,663 ± 36 m3...  Photographs of the source area taken immediately after the 7 October rock fall suggest that of this total cumulative volume, ~20% (~1,133 m3) is attributable to the [7 October] event and the remainder (~4,530 m3) attributable to the subsequent 8 October rock fall.""     (4)  According to Park Geologist Greg Stock:  Observation of the detachment surface from the ground immediately after the rock fall occurred did not reveal the presence of water, and close inspection of this surface from a helicopter approximately 45 minutes after the rock fall occurred likewise showed the surface to be dry.  However, staining on the rock surface indicates that water was at least occasionally present behind the failed slab and may have helped to destablize the slab (during spring runoff and immediately after storms, a water streak is visible directly across the detachment surface).  The extent of staining suggested that much of the slab was previously detached from the rock behind it, with seven areas of attachment represented about 26% of the total detachment surface area.  In addition, the bottom of the failed slab was a roof created by earlier rock falls in August and September 2001 [see IDs 2001091401, 2001091402, 2001092502].  These earlier rock falls likely also played a role in the progressive destabilization of the block.  Despite these contributing factors, an exact trigger for the 8 October 2008 rock fall is not unrecognized.     (5)  Stock et al. (2011) performed structural analyses of the rock-fall detachment surface and surrounding area utilizing high-resolution digital photographs and ground-based laser scanning (LiDAR) data.  Detachment occurred along a surface parallel sheeting joint oriented 027°/89° (dip direction/dip angle).  Stock et al. (2011) suggest that shear (sliding) failure was the most likely failure mode, and may related to stress concentration at crack tips within the attached areas."

The detachment surface was roughly square, ~3 x 3 m, and comparison of repeat photographs suggest the failed slab was relatively thin, ~1 m.  The detachment surface was a distinct orange color, suggesting advanced weathering of the bedrock there.  A brown streak emanated from the source area down the cliff, suggesting that at least some soil was mobilized, as well as rock.  Impacts on the cliff near ""Central Pillar of Frenzy"" produced a small dust cloud.  Much of the rock debris from the rock fall was deposited on the talus slope, but approximately 1 m3 of rock debris extended beyond and impacted Southside Drive where the edge of the talus slope is closest to the road; debris was distributed on the road over a length of approximately 60 m.

Although an exact source area location was not determined, it is almost certain that these rock falls were smaller precursors to the very large rock mass that fell from Ahwiyah Point a few hours later [ID 2009032801].  Volume analyses are cumulative for all rock falls occurring during the period 28-29 March 2009, but based on the reported sounds the volume of this event was likely in the range of 200 m3.     (2)  From Zimmer et al. (2012):  ""According to eyewitness reports from rock climbers located across the valley from Ahwiyah Point, the series began with a large rock fall during the night, followed by several hours of punctuated smaller rock falls..."""

(2012),"(1)  According to Park Geologist Greg Stock:  This was the largest in a series of rock falls from Ahwiyah Point, located above Mirror Lake on the south wall of Tenaya Canyon, approximately 800 m northeast of Half Dome.  Repeat laser scanning revealed that this largest rock fall consisted of the failure of a block 50 m wide, 80 m tall, and 26 m thick (maximum dimensions), for a total volume of approximately 24,800 m3.  This block slid approximately 300 meters down the northwest face of Ahwiyah Point, removing approximately 2,000 m3 of rock slabs and other projections from the face, before impacting a prominent bedrock ledge about 400 m above the floor of Tenaya Canyon.  This impact dislodged an additional approximately 18,400 m3 of rock from the ledge, leaving a wedge-shaped void.     (2)  According to rock climber David Allfrey (written commun., 31 March 2009):  Allfrey was bivouacked on Dinner Ledge midway up Washington Column and, having heard several smaller rock falls earlier in the night, sat up immediately when he heard the loud rumbling.  In the dark, he observed the block sliding down the upper face as a long orange streak, as sparks were produced by rock-on-rock sliding and ledge impacts.  ""...at the pre-dawn hours I woke to a huge ... boom, jerked up, looked over to see the entire side of Ahwiyah Point shrouded in a massive dust cloud falling down, the lead end looked like a massive fireworks shows.  When it slammed into the floor [of Tenaya Canyon], it crashed down into a huge plume of dust that went upwards and pushed out all the way across the valley floor"".     (3)  According to Park Geologist Greg Stock:  Acquisition of subsequent airborne and ground-based laser scanning data, and comparison with airborne laser scanning data obtained prior to the rock fall, indicate that a total of 46,700 m3 of rock mobilized during the event.  The combined rock-fall debris (derived from the source area, smaller ledges, and from the mid-cliff impact point), traveled down the lower face and impacted the floor of Tenaya Canyon, knocking down hundreds of trees and burying a portion of the Mirror Lake Loop Trail in rock debris to a depth of several meters.  An air blast from the event leveled additional trees up to 30 m past the rock-fall deposition zone.  The impact of the debris was detected by seismometers up to 400 km distant, registering as a magnitude 2.4 earthquake; this shaking was most likely as a result of the collision of the source area rock mass onto the lower ledge (http://seismo.berkeley.edu/blogs/seismoblog/php/2009/03/30). Because the rock fall occurred in a relatively remote location (Tenaya Canyon) before sunrise, there were no injuries or fatalities; however, the Mirror Lake loop trail was completely destroyed at this location.  When the area was observed roughly three hours after the rock fall occurred, dust coated every surface in the Mirror Lake area and was floating on the lake surface.  The thickest accumulations were directly across Tenaya Creek from the final impact point and were up to 1 cm thick in places.  The detachment surface showed several prominent areas of seepage; recent warm temperatures with associated snowmelt, and a lack of recent precipitation, suggest that snowmelt was the most likely source of water.  Although an exact trigger is not known with certainty, water in the form of snowmelt is considered the most likely trigger.     (4)  From Zimmer et al. (2012):  ""The total volume consists of 25,400 m3 from the rock-fall source area, 2,000 m3 from intermediate blocks dislodged as the rock fall traveled downwards along the upper cliff face, and 19,300 m3 from the mid-cliff impact of the rock fall on the lower promontory.  A minor additional amount of rock (estimated to be less than 1,000 m3) was detached below this point and prior to final impact.  Unpon final impact at the base of the cliff, the rock fall remobilized an additional 7,000 m3 of existing accumulating talus, pushing the upper portion of the talus slope downward and outward.  The average talus slope angle was reduced from 31° to 29°, the height of the talus at the apex was lowered by up to 13 m, and the toe was extended by 48 m horizontally for a 50 m distance parallel to the base...  Cross-sections generated through the pre- and post-rock fall surfaces show that the source block consisted on an 80 m long, 50 m wide, 26 mthick block, measured at its maximum dimensions.   Analysis of the point and surface data show that failure occurred along the intersection of four prominent intersecting planes (joints) consisting of an approximately 67° inclined, northwest-dipping surface (approximate dip/dip direction = 67°/322°) a 67° inclined, west-dipping surface (approximate dip/dip direction = 67°/272°), a 90° inclined, west-dipping surface (approximate dip/dip direction = 90°/236°), and a 46° inclined, west-dipping surface (approximate dip/dip direction = 46°/262°) which formed the bottom sliding surface of the rock fall...  The source block was further bounded by several east-dipping roofs inclined at between 51° and 59° (average dip/dip direction = 56°/097°)...  Analysis of the mid-cliff impact zone indicates that a wedge formed by two intersecting planes (joints) was dislodged by the impact of rock debris from above.  The wedge is formed by the intersection of a 59° inclined, northwest-dipping surface (approximate dip/dip direction = 59°/319°) and a 58° inclined, southwest-dipping surface (approximate dip/dip direction = 58°/224°)..."""

Several of these rock falls were substantial in volume (up to a few tens of m3) and produced small dust clouds.  The largest rock fall observed by Stock was approximately 15 m3 in volume.  Most of these rock falls appeared to consist of debris that was perched on ledges beneath the initial source area, but at least two rock falls appeared to have initiated from the initial source area.  These secondary rock falls may have also been triggered by snowmelt, but their failure was almost certainly related to the initial larger failure through stress redistribution or gradual settling of rock debris.

(2012a),"(1)  According to Park Geologist Greg Stock and Brian Collins of the U.S. Geological Survey:  This was the largest in the series of rock falls from the Rhombus Wall on 26 August 2009.  This rock mass was approximately 558 m3 in volume as determined by repeat photography and laser scanning, and was captured by numerous photographers throughout eastern Yosemite Valley.  The majority of the debris that traveled beyond the edge of the talus slope landed just east of the valet parking gate and just west of the Royal Arches Creek streambed.  Five vehicles were damaged in this area, including a minivan that was fully penetrated by an approximately 0.2 m3 rock fragment, but there were no injuries.  The largest boulder that extended beyond the edge of the talus slope, approximately 1.5 m3 in volume, landed in the Royal Arches Creek streambed just upstream of the small bridge leading to the valet parking area.  The farthest traveled boulder was approximately 20 m southeast of the streambed.  Several 1-2 m3 boulders were documented in the talus north of the bear boxes and the bedrock mortar boulder along the Valley Loop Trail.  Debris in this area was generally stopped by large boulders on the margin of the talus.  Judging from the location of broken tree limbs, high up nearby tree trunks at the base of the talus, the rock fall boulders that reached beyond the talus followed fairly steep incoming trajectories before then bouncing along the valley floor where they impacted several trees before coming to rest.  Several flyrock fragments smaller than baseballs landed in the paved parking area north and northeast of the Ahwahnee reflecting pond, but there were no injuries or vehicle damage in this area.  Photos of the source area immediately after the failure show water present on the detachment surface in several discrete streaks.  However, it is not clear whether this water was involved in triggering the initial rock fall, or whether the water was simply revealed on the detachment surface by a failure incited by some other mechanism.  There was some seepage from beneath the new roof formed by the rock falls that was visible by spotting scope only; the seepage persisted until 31 August 2009, decreasing slightly each day.  Regardless of the initial triggering mechanism, it seems likely that the subsequent rock falls were the result of stress redistribution following earlier rock falls, hence the progressive nature of the event occurring over minutes and hours.  The detachment surface was roughly triangular in shape, with maximum dimensions of 36.5 by 13.5 m.  Terrestrial LiDAR-based measurements of the new roof formed by the rock falls suggest that the failed slab was approximately 3 m thick.  Subsequent ground-based laser scanning of the cliff by Brian Collins of the U.S. Geological Survey, and comparison with airborne laser scanning data collected prior to the failure, revealed a cumulative volume for all of the rock falls occurring on 26 August 2009 of 740 m3.  UTM coordinates for the apex of the rock-fall source area are 273319.21E  4181246.66N (NAD83 zone 11N), with an elevation of 1576.05 m.     (2)  From Stock et al. (2012a):  ""At 13:09 PST, a much larger rock fall occurred above and west of the earlier failures, along the same sheeting joint surface.  This slab had a volume of approximately 558 m3, the largest of all of the 2009-2010 Rhombus Wall rock falls.  This rock fall was widely documented by park visitors, employees, and residents throughout eastern Yosemite Valley.  Rock debris, including boulders as large as 2 m in diameter, bounced and rolled to the base of the talus slope and damaged unoccupied vehicles in the parking lot of the Ahwahnee Hotel."""

(2012a),"(1)  According to Park Geologist Greg Stock:  A rock fall occurred from the Rhombus Wall, immediately adjacent to the 26 August 2009 rock-fall source area (see ID 2009082606).  Numerous parties reported the rock fall from the Ahwahnee Hotel, and the resulting dust cloud was widely visible throughout the eastern part of Yosemite Valley.  No rock debris reached the Ahwahnee parking lot.  The rock fall originated from the rock face immediately above and slightly east of the overhanging roof created by the 26 August 2009 events.     The failed rock mass consisted of a triangular slab approximately 35 x 12 x <1 m (maximum dimensions).  The detachment surface was a J1 sheeting joint less than 1 m below the pre-failure cliff surface, and was distinct from (shallower than) the detachment surface of the 26 August 2009 rock falls.  Repeat photography and laser scanning of the source area revealed the volume to be 108 m3.  This failure was preceded by several weeks of cracking sounds, as well as visible expansion of the crack aperture behind the failed slab.  Failure was  likely related to crack propagation due to stress redistribution in response to the earlier failures, but beyond that there were no obvious triggers; the weather was clear with mild temperatures, and the source area was dry at the time of failure, though dark brown water stains were present on the detachment surface.    (2)  From Stock et al. (2012a):  ""Over the next 3 weeks [following the 26 August 2009 rock falls], cracking sounds were heard emanating from the Rhombus Wall from as far away as 1 km on at least four occasions, although they could not be definitively tied to the location of the 26 August 2009 rock falls.  Visual monitoring from the ground and by helicopter during this period indicated that the aperature of a sheeting joint just beneath the cliff surface above hte overhang created by the 26 August 2009 rock falls irreversibly widened by several centimeters... A 17:12 PST on 14 September 2009 a rock mass with a volume of 108 m3 detached along the aforementioned sheeting joint.  The joint was essentially parallel to the failure surface of the 26 August 2009 rock falls, but located at a much shallower depth (0.8 versus 3.1 m).  The failure surface of the 14 September 2009 rock fall is an eastward continuation of the failure surface of the last rock fall that occurred on 26 August 2009.  As with the earlier failures, the exposed failure surface shows some water staining, primarily near its center, with freshly fractured rock along the perimeter.  Although the failure surface was dry when observed within 10 minutes after the rock fall occurred, the presence of water staining indicates that the sheeting joint was at least partially open and transmitting water behind the sheet for some time prior to the failure."""

The event was widely witnessed by visitors in El Capitan Meadow and climbers on the southeast face of El Capitan, in part because of the smaller rock fall that occurred from the same location about two minutes earlier.  The failure surface was roughly triangular in shape, approximately 33 m tall and 40 m wide at the base, with an approximate thickness of 1.5 m, for a total volume of approximately 990 m3.  Rock climber Adam Long observed the rock fall while climbing on the southeast face of El Capitan, and clearly observed the slab fail by shear (rather than toppling) as a single intact slab.  The slab fell parallel to the cliff face about 200 m before impacting a large ledge at the base of the cliff, fragmenting into numerous boulders and producing a large dust cloud.  These boulders then bounced and rolled over the cliff below the ledge (along the path of lower Horsetail Fall) to impact the talus slope at the base of the cliff.  No fresh rock debris went beyond the base of the talus.  The dust cloud was visible throughout Yosemite Valley for approximately 30 minutes after the rock fall occurred.

Comparison of photos taken immediately after this event with ones taken on 5 July 2011 show two new source areas, one above the other.  The upper source area, adjacent to (immediately west of) the source area of the 5 July 2011 rock fall, likely failed on 12 July 2011.  The lower source area likely failed on 1 September 2011.

He was stopped in construction traffic on Northside Drive near Valley View when he heard a very loud rumble from the cliffs to the north. He was unable to pinpoint an exact source area, but tentatively placed it at or near the Rockslides.  Subsequent observation from Tunnel View failed to locate the source area.  It is possible that the rock fall occurred from Last Resort Cliff, where an earlier failure occurred [see ID 2011013101].Based on the sound of the rock fall, the volume is estimated at ~20 m3."

Debris ""included fine crushed rock dust at several impact points and several boulders shattered into fragments no larger than 2 m on any side.""  Zimmer described the cumulative volume as ""pickup truck to dump truck volume"", or about 10-15 m3, scattered over an area of approximately 30 m x 30 m.  Assuming the rock fall happened after rain and snow on 20 November (based on preservation of fine rock dust in the impact area), the event occurred sometime between 20 November and noon on 24 November.  The source area was likely high in the Ribbon Falls amphitheater."

He heard a single rock falling down the cliff for approximately 10 seconds.  The weather was  clear and sunny with no recent precipitation."

The rock fall source area was  approximately 70 meters above the bench trail in an overhanging, already-weathered roof area with a tree nearby. The rock fall detached, impacted the cliffs near the base, and likely remobilized at least an additional 10 m3 of old rock fall debris on the loose slope.  This combined debris cut through the middle of all three switchbacks on the trail, with boulders coming to rest above, on, and below the trail for a width of 3-5 meters.  There were no injuries associated with the event."

Approximately 15 m3 of rock debris fell from beneath an overhanging roof and landed on the road, causing minor damage to the road surface.  No information on local conditions was provided, so the trigger is unknown, but subsequent photos of the rock-fall source area showed that the overhang had roots from an adjacent Ponderosa Pine sticking out underneath it, and these roots may have contributed to the failure."

They heard a loud rumble from near Sentinel Rock and barely perceived a dust cloud in the darkness. Subsequent observation of the debris slide scar along upper Sentinel Creek showed fresh surfaces, suggesting that it was source. Weather clear, mild, with no recent precipitation."

Lingo was on the talus slope by the upper Indian Cave entrance and heard three loud booms coming from Tenaya Canyon. Looking in that direction he saw a dust cloud near Half Dome. An exact source area not determined, but it possibly derived from Ahwiyah Point.  The weather was clear and cool with no recent precipitation."
